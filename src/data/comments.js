Lots of hours are spent in the office, chained to a desk like any other job. I donâ€™t mean to send out an unrealistic message that people can travel around the world and get paid for it, even if thatâ€™s how it looks sometimes. If you want to get into travel writing, setting up a blog is the best place to start. It allows you to publish your work immediately and get your name out there. Try to build a following and a community and once you have this set up it demonstrates a pro active side to you and a passion for travel writing. If you go into any content / copywriting / journalistic job in the travel industry, an established travel blog would put you in great stead. Wishing you all the best in your career and your ventures ðŸ™‚ Canâ€™t wait to see what you create!"
