        title: 'On being asked; ‘Are you going to have another?’',
        comments: 4,
        date: '11/04/21',
        content: `“Are you going to have another?”, asked a well-meaning family member, out of the blue. Another cup of coffee? Another what? It could have been anything, but I knew exactly what they meant. Another baby. The question that fills me with dread.

        It seems like when your first child enters toddlerhood, there is a societal expectation, or assumption, that all mothers are yearning for the next one. For me, that couldn’t be further from the truth.

        Why assume there will be a next one? For many, one is enough.

        After extreme prematurity, neonatal surgeries, a 3.5 month NICU stay, post natal anxiety, PTSD and a global pandemic, motherhood has well and truly consumed me, challenged me and changed me.

        I feel like there is so much we still have to experience with Theo. He is a healthy and happy little boy ready to see the world. But it’s not just about Theo.

        I am working hard on my own personal development and having further therapy for my trauma. I am healing and reconnecting with parts of old myself. I want to write a book! I am unapologetically making myself a priority again.

        Having another baby is not a priority right now, and perhaps it never will be. All I know is that this little boy and his Daddy complete me and they are all I need.

        Now that restrictions are slowly lifting, we are ready to start living our best life and making memories that go beyond the local playground, as a family of 3.

        Female adult life isn’t all about having babies. There is so much more available to us now.

        Please always be careful when asking people about their family plans. You don’t always know what they’ve been through, or are going through.

        Have you ever been asked a similar question and how did you deal with it? I’d love to know.`,

        title: 'A Review of the Micralite ProFold Pram',
        comments: 0,
        date: '06/12/20',
        content: `As Theo grew from a baby to a toddler, I decided that it was time to move on to smaller, lighter and more nimble every-day pram. We had been using our Joolz Day3 ever since Theo came home from hospital, and the transition from its bassinet to front facing seat was seamless. However, at around 20 months, I realised that Theo no longer needed such a cumbersome pram frame and that it was time to reclaim my car boot space! Cue the Micralite ProFold.

        I was attracted to the Micralite ProFold for three main reasons. I thought it was sleek and aesthetically pleasing, but I also loved that it went into a horizontal position for naps and also was compact enough for a plane cabin. It weighs 7kg, is suitable for use from birth to 15kg and retails at £275. Read on for my full Micralite ProFold review.
        
        To say how light and compact the Micralite ProFold is, the seat positioning is incredibly versatile. We also own a Babyzen YoYo and I have always been frustrated by how even the most upright position is very ‘slouchy’. My son Theo got frustrated with it as he wanted to sit more upright and see the world.

        By comparison, the Micralife ProFold can be adjusted to a more upright position and on the other end of the spectrum, it also goes horizontal. Personally I think the vertical seat positioning is a huge plus point of this pram as its perfect for when your little one needs a nap on the go (great for days out, weekends away and holidays). The foot rest also kicks up into a flat position, so your child can comfortably lay flat out in the land of slumber.
        
        Another huge plus point of the Micralite ProFold is how compact it is when collapsed. Compared to the Joolz Day3, it takes up a tiny amount of space in my boot and is small enough to fit in most plane overhead lockers. The benefit of this is that you can take the pram through the airport with you and into the plane cabin, rather than having to check it in as a piece of luggage. I know we aren't travelling very much at the moment but it’s certainly worth considering for the future!
        
        In terms of design, I would say the Micralite ProFold has both style and substance. We have it in Graphite which is a lovely grey shade that looks super stylish with the brown details. As well as its curb appeal, the pram has thoughtful features such as a built in pocket under the handlebar (perfect for parents phones, keys, purse). I also really like the clear window on the pram roof / canopy as it means parents can glance down and check on their child very easily.

        It pops up and collapses in one quick, easy movement, which makes life that little bit easier (watch my Instagram reel for a demo). It feels like its a pram that has been designed by parents, for parents. The Micralite ProFold also has suspension so it is a smoother ride than the Babyzen YoYo.

        There are two things I have found about the Micralite Profold that could definitely be changed and improved. Firstly, the foot break is positioned in a way that makes it easy to accidentally kick when you are walking. The result is that I often find myself accidentally putting the pram into break mode as I am walking along, which is not very nice for your small passenger. Another design fault is that the padding around the straps is not fixed with any velcro, meaning that the padding can easily slide off when the harness is not clipped in. For this reason we have ended up taking the padding off so we don't lose it.

        Despite these design glitches, I would still recommend the Micralite ProFold and think that it has a huge amount of great features to offer. I think the price is really reasonable and you can trust that you are getting a high quality pram with style and substance.

        The Micralite ProFold retails at £275 but is currently on a cyber month offer with micralite.com for only £150.

        What did you think of my Micralite ProFold review? Are you in the middle of choosing a new pram? If you have any further questions about this pram, feel free to leave a comment in the box below.

        Disclaimer: This Micalite ProFold pram was given to me a press sample but I was under no obligation to write about it. I have chosen to write this review as I feel the pram is a good quality product that I am happy to recommend. All words are honest and my own.`,

        content: `Hey guys! I’m excited to share some big news. I’ve got a job! It’s an amazing communications role at a national UK charity.

        Since 2016, running The Travelista has been my full time job and sole source of income. I have travelled the world through a job that I created, and I could not be more proud of this. However, my life evolved when I became a Mum and suddenly and traumatically (15 weeks earlier than expected) my lifestyle totally changed.
        
        Then Covid came along. My blog earnings took a hit and the summer lockdown with a young toddler was difficult to say the least. I was left feeling burnt out and desperate for a bit of structure. I also craved some financial certainty. I realised what I needed and went looking for it, in the middle of a pandemic.
        
        I am proud to be a working Mum and I am pleased to say I feel like I have designed the ideal working scenario for myself now. But fear not, The Travelista isn’t going anywhere!
        
        The new job is part time so I work 3 days a week for the charity and have the rest of my week to dedicate to Theo and do bits for The Travelista. I spend some evenings and Sundays working on blog content, but only if I want to. I don’t put any pressure on myself. The result is that I am enjoying my content creation so much more. As a part time employee and a small business owner, I sort of feel as though I now have the best of both worlds.
        
        I am learning so much in the job and although I work from home, I feel so much more connected to the outside world. Its very nice to be part of a team again and feel like I am making a difference for a charity with a very good cause. So far the job has been very good for my mental health.
        
        After totally losing myself in the first year of motherhood, this is a really positive step for me and one that I thought was worth celebrating. So that’s one good thing to come out of 2020.
        
        Now, tell me one positive thing that has happened to you in 2020? `,

        title: 'A Toddler-Friendly Holiday in North Devon',
        comments: 2,
        date: '04/10/20',
        content: `Last month we bravely loaded up the car and set off on the 6 hour drive from Leeds to North Devon, with our 22 month toddler in tow. This holiday was our Plan B after our flights to Spain were cancelled due to Covid. I was really happy with the Plan B we had come up with and was looking forward to getting away and to experiencing Devon for the very first time.

        Joining us on holiday were my parents / Theo’s grandparents, making us a party of 5. We were all supposed to be going to Spain together, so naturally we all made a new plan together. They are really helpful and hands-on with Theo, so I was very glad to have them with us. Here's what we got up to on our wonderful family holiday in North Devon.
        
        A TODDLER FRIENDLY HOLIDAY IN NORTH DEVON
        DAY 1 - WALKING TO LEE VILLAGE AND LEE BAY
        After the 6 hour drive turned into a horrific 8+ hour journey from hell, we wanted our first full day in North Devon to be as relaxing as possible. We spent the morning getting our bearings on the farm, and Theo got to feed the resident goats, sheep and donkeys.

        In the afternoon we took the public footpath from Lower Camp Scott Farm to Lee Bay, which is the closest beach to our accommodation. The route of the bridle path is stunning and takes you through a magical woodland and through the pretty village of Lee (the village pub The Grampus is great to stop for a drink in the beer garden, but the food isn’t anything special).

        Lee Bay is definitely worth a visit, but its worth mentioning that it’s not a beach. It’s an enclave of rock pools and little pools of water, that children will love exploring. Theo loved dipping in and out of the rockpools, but it did also feel very hazardous for a toddler. Theo had a blast, but Mum and Dad didn’t find it very relaxing! From Lee Bay you can take the beautiful coastal paths to Ilfracombe and Woolacombe.

        DAY 2 - COOMBE MARTIN DINOSAUR AND WILDLIFE PARK
        On Day 2 we booked tickets in advance for Coombe Martin Dinosaur and Wildlife Park. The park interestingly spreads across two woodland valleys. The setting is beautiful, but the many steps and ramps means that it’s not ideal for a pram (although not impossible). The best part of the park was definitely the Dinosaur valley. The mechanical dinosaurs were very lifelike (especially to children) and the setting felt very ‘Jurassic park’. For children who are seriously into their dinosaurs, a walk through the valley would be wildly exciting.

        I was a lot less impressed at the wildlife valley, as the enclosures looked very tired and in need of some upkeep and the animals all looked a bit sad. I wouldn’t recommend the wildlife valley, but you can only buy a ticket for general admission, rather than for the dinosaur valley only. There’s also an amazing indoor soft play area included in the admission price, so I would still say it’s worth a visit.

        We spent about 3 hours at the park we went straight to Coombe Martin Bay which was a quick 5 minute drive away. It’s a lovely beach, but it doesn’t have the soft golden sands of nearby Woolacombe and Croyde. The beach is quite shingly so it’s worth getting some jelly shoes for little ones. There is public parking right by the beach which was really handy, and Coombe Martin itself is a pretty little village with cafes and shops.
        
        DAY 3 - WOOLACOMBE BEACH AND DINNER AT THE JUBE
        Day 3 was set to be a September scorcher (reaching 26 degrees) so we decided to spend a full afternoon at Woolacombe Beach. This was my favourite day of the holiday by far, mainly because of the weather and because of how much Theo adored the beach. He was so happy and content playing in the sand and exploring. The ‘surf’ was also amazing on this day so Mum and Dad also got to have fun in the sea with a Boogie board. Woolacombe is 4.8km long and very wide, so there was plenty of space for him to run around without getting close to other groups.
        
        My main tip for visiting Woolacombe Beach is to arrive as prepared as possible. The beach itself isn’t lined with cafes or with toilets, so make sure you bring plenty of drinks, snacks and visit the loo before you find a base for the day. The nearest public toilets are by the Esplanade car park and there are shops and restaurants in the town itself.
        
        My parents took Theo back to the cottage and Scott and I stayed out for dinner in Woolacombe. We found a great little pub called The Jube which is hidden away from the main streets. We both ordered burgers which were fantastic and ate outside in the small beer garden. It was a great end to an amazing day. You can't have a holiday in North Devon without visiting Woolacombe beach!
        
        DAY 4 - LYNTON AND LYNMOUTH
        A family friend suggested that we visit the twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth for a nice day out. Both towns are connected by the famous Lynton and Lynmouth Railway, which is the world's highest and steepest completely water powered railway. It's a Victorian funicular which dates back to 1890. The fare is £3 for an adult single and children under 4 travel free.
        
        We parked our car at Lynton, which is a very pretty town that has some incredible interior and homeware shops. If I was child-free, I could have spent hours pottering around the interesting shops. I popped my head in a few, and then we stopped for lunch before catching the funicular down to Lynmouth. We didn’t need to book tickets in advance, we just stood in the short queue and bought one-way tickets.
        
        Lynmouth is very small but it’s a nice place to stop for lunch or an ice cream. It has lots of nice shops to explore too. We only spent about an hour here before catching the funicular back up to Lynton. It’s worth knowing that there’s an outdoor playground for kids which is located over the bridge of the West Lyn river.`,

        content: `As many of you will know, prematurity is now a topic very close to my heart after my own son Theo was born prematurely at 25 weeks. As well as posting about travel and motherhood, I also try to raise awareness about prematurity whenever I can (particularly on my Instagram). But today I am glad to raise awareness on my blog and to spread the word about 'Soothing the Smallest', a fantastic campaign between Sudocrem and premature baby charity Ickle Pickles.

        SOOTHING THE SMALLEST
        Every year, 1 in 8 babies are born prematurely, that’s 100,000 babies every single year. Just like Theo, these babies need to spend weeks, sometimes months, in neonatal care units before they are strong enough to leave. Neonatal intensive care costs the NHS thousands of pounds every day and many hospitals do not have the equipment to care for extremely preterm babies.

        This autumn, Sudocrem and premature baby charity Ickle Pickles are teaming up to raise funds for the vital neonatal equipment premature babies so desperately need. In honour of the partnership a new, limited edition pot of ‘My Ickle Sudocrem’ has been created and will be sold in Boots and Tesco stores across the UK for six weeks from the 26th of August. Each sale of the ‘ickle pot' will mean 50p donated to Ickle Pickles. An historic event for the brand, Sudocrem have never before adapted their classic packaging for a charity campaign such as this. A typical ventilator costs £25,000, the equivalent of 50,000 little pots.

        title: 'A Night Away with the Micralite Sleep & Go Lite Travel Cot',
        comments: 0,
        date: '29/07/20',
        content: `Last weekend we had our first night away from home since the UK lockdown began. We went to Cleethorpes for the weekend and had an overnight stay at Theo’s Nannies house. It felt so nice to pack our bags and get away. It was also the perfect opportunity to try out our new Sleep & Go Lite travel cot by Micralite. The original Sleep & Go cot is a clever travel cot is a 3-in-1 bassinet, travel cot and playpen. The Sleep & Go Lite works in exactly the same way, but without the newborn bassinet. Here’s my review of the Sleep & Go as a Mum of a very active 17 month old. I hope you this post helps you find the right travel cot for you.
        
        MICRALITE SLEEP & GO LITE TRAVEL COT REVIEW
        LIGHT AND COMPACT
        Firstly, I love how light and compact the Sleep & Go Lite is. It comes neatly stored in a black zip bag with handles, meaning you can throw it over your shoulder whilst carrying other bits. It fit easily into the boot of our car, although being 88cm in length, it wouldn’t fit into a suitcase. If you were flying with this travel cot it would need to be a standalone piece of luggage.

        THE SET UP
        Once we arrived at the in-laws, I went upstairs to put the travel cot up. Having played around with the cot before at home, I already knew it was super easy to set up. It’s literally a case of sliding it out of the bag, and standing the legs out until you hear the ‘click’ to confirm they’re safely in place. Then you just insert the padded mattress which also comes in the bag. Watch my IGTV below to see how easy it is to put up.

        I would say that the mattress is quite firm but still comfortable and does the job. We forgot to bring a fitted sheet for the mattress but the material is wipe clean so we didn’t have to worry too much.

        COLLAPSING DOWN
        We found it just as easy to put the Sleep & Go down as we did to put it up. All you need to do is find the black buttons on the frames to collapse the legs. It all folds back into a streamlined shape ready to slide into the storage bag.

        GREAT FOR PLAY TIME
        It’s really handy that the Sleep & Go can also be used as a play pen and in hindsight I could have been using it for this purpose throughout lockdown. It also has a plastic coated bottom so you could use it in the garden.

        CHOOSING BETWEEN THE SLEEP & GO ORIGINAL AND THE SLEEP & GO LITE
        Just to be clear, the Sleep & Go Lite (£135) does not come with the insert bassinet or a zip down side for play time. This makes it ideal for older babies (6 months+) and toddlers who wouldn't need the bassinet. The original Sleep & Go is a little more expensive (£169.99) but comes with the newborn bassinet and zip down side. Other than those differences, they are very similar and operate in exactly the same way.

        I think the zip down side is a great feature when using the travel cot for play time, especially as your child gets older. I think it's a shame this feature isn't included on the Sleep & Go Lite as well.
        
        THE VERDICT
        For us, the Micralite Sleep & Go travel cot ticks every box. It’s both stylish and functional, with various uses as your baby grows. It’s unlikely we’d ever need to fly with it so the length is not an issue for us. Its safe and sturdy, even when housing a boisterous toddler!`,

        title: '6 Things to Avoid Saying to a Mum of a Premature Baby',
        comments: 1,
        date: '27/07/20',
        content: `I have had many a conversation with fellow mums of premature babies and it seems to be a common theme that we’ve all been on the receiving end of some quite hurtful comments. These comments aren’t meant to be hurtful, but they still hurt. They could easily be said by a friend or family member who has the best intentions, but they show a definite lack of understanding of what we are going through or have recently been through. I’m writing this post to raise awareness about what a mum of a premature baby goes through and if this post helps to stop one insensitive comment to a fellow mum then it will have done its job 🙂

        5 THINGS TO NEVER SAY TO A MUM OF A PREMATURE BABY
        1. “AW, HES SO TINY”
        He’s not tiny. He’s absolutely huge compared to the 800g he was. You have no idea of the blood sweat and tears it’s taken for him to reach 6lb.
        
        2. “AT LEAST YOU DIDN’T GET ANY STRETCH MARKS”
        I had this one and I was actually lost for words. No, we didn’t get stretch marks, but that would have been such an obscenely small price to pay in exchange for having a healthy term baby.
        
        3. “YOU’RE LUCKY YOU SKIPPED THE HARDEST PART OF PREGNANCY”
        We would have done anything to have had end stage of pregnancy. We feel robbed of our pregnancies. We had to grieve our pregnancies. Getting to experience a smooth, term pregnancy is not a given. It’s an absolute privilege.
        
        4. “DON’T YOU JUST MISS THE NEWBORN DAYS?”
        No, we don’t. When our babies were newly born we were away from home. We lived in a hospital. We expressed 8-12 times every 24 hours. We were separated by an incubator and held our babies once a day and only if they were well enough.
        
        5. “HOW AMAZING IS THAT FIRST HOLD?”
        It wasn’t amazing. It was terrifying. Most Mums wait days and even weeks to hold their premature baby (I waited 9 days). When we first hold them, they’re covered in tubes, tapes and wires. We’re scared to move. That magical moment of holding your baby after birth is another privilege that was taken away.
        
        6. “CONGRATULATIONS! IT’S A BOY / GIRL!”
        I know they’re such kind gestures but receiving ‘it’s a boy’ cards and gifts felt uncomfortable and too soon. Especially in the first 6 weeks when we didn’t know if he would survive. It’s far from a time of celebration. I did receive a few ‘thinking of you’ cards and they felt much more comforting and appropriate.
        
        A female consultant said Congratulations to me a few hours after Theo was born and I was speechless. I didn’t know if my baby was going to live or die. After a few seconds I said ‘I don’t think Congratulations is the right word’. She later apologised to me and thanked me for telling her.
        
        3 Things You Could do / Say to a Mum of a Premature Baby

        I’m so sorry this has happened. I can’t imagine what you’re going through but I am here for you every step of the way
        You are still the single most important person in your babies life 
        What can I bring you to make your days a little easier? You could suggest bringing a home cooked meal, freezer meals, new toiletries or to do some washing or household tasks.

        During my time in NICU someone sent me the quote ‘from tiny acorns, mighty oaks grow’. It really touched me and I remember it to this day.
        
        I hope this gives some insight into what it’s like to have a premature baby. Can any Mums add to the list?`,

        title: 'My Favourite Baby Products from Newborn to Toddler',
        comments: 7,
        date: '10/05/20',
        content: `Whilst all is quiet on the travel front, I’ve been working on this bumper blog post of all the best baby products I’ve found since becoming a Mum. Some of the products we bought before Theo was born, so this may help anyone working out what to buy for a newborn. Some of the products we bought further down the line when we began to wean and transfer Theo into his own cot. Everything listed in his blog post is currently in my house and, at some point, was used every single day. I know how overwhelming shopping for a new baby can be, especially when its your first, so I really hope this post comes in handy for new parents and parents to be. Like many new parents, Amazon has been a total god send for us and its where we've bought almost all of this stuff. You can trust everything has been tried and tested by me, a first time Mum.

        The items have been liked to on Amazon and put in age-appropriate order, starting from newborn items and moving through to toddler items. A few of the items within the list have been gifted, but most of the items we have bought ourselves after research and advice. I love every product that is featured in this post. 
        
        THE BIG TICKET ITEMS
        Cribs, prams and car seats are a good place to start for a newborn shopping list, but I know the amount of choice can feel totally overwhelming. Different products are right for different people, but the following products were perfect for us.
                
        SNUZ POD BEDSIDE CRIB
        Theo slept in a SnuzPod 3 in our room until he was about six months old (following UK sleep safety guidelines). There are lots of different bedside cribs on the market and I remember doing a lot of research on them at the time. We went for the SunzPod 3 and I have absolutely no regrets. The best feature about the Snuzpod 3 is that you can lift off the bassinet and easily move it around the house. This means it can double up as a safe place for your baby to sleep downstairs through the day.
                
        JOOLZ DAY3
        Choosing the pram was about the only thing we did before Theo’s early arrival. Now at 18 months old, we are still using the Joolz Day3 every day. We started with the newborn bassinet until around 7 months and then switched to the more up-right pram fitting. The great thing about the pram fitting is that it has 3 angles and can go completely flat for naps. Read my full review of the Joolz Day3 here. The Day3 is Joolz' latest model from the Day collection and retails at £899.99 at John Lewis.
                
        JOOLZ NURSERY BAG
        We also got the Joolz nursery bag in the same colour in the pram (ours was ‘Amazing Grey’). I loved that the bag perfectly coordinated with the pram and it came with attachments that hook onto the pram with ease. Its spacious with lots of compartments. The best features are the changing mat and the isolated section to keep liquids cool / warm.
                
        JOIE 2-IN-1 SWING
        When we realised how soothed Theo was by being rocked in his car seat, we wanted to find a seat to mimic the same movement. Theo was around 4 weeks old when we bought this swing and it was an absolute game changer. He napped in this beautifully throughout the day and it gave him a safe and stimulating place to spend time if I needed to leave the room. It rocks in two directions at various speed settings, plays music and vibrates. I was so happy with this product and highly recommend.
                
        FIRST CAR SEAT: MAXI COSI PEBBLE I-SIZE (NEWBORN TO 1 YEAR OR 13KG)
        Of all the choices in the world of baby products, I found the car seat the most overwhelming. There is just so much choice and its such alien territory. We bought the Maxi Cosi Pebble for Theo's first car seat as it was strongly recommended by my friend. It met all the latest i-size safety requirements and the additional insert made it snug and safe for our tiny preemie. At the same time, we also bought the Maxi Cosi FamilyFix i-Size isofix base. This car seat is rear facing in line with safety guidance.
                
        MAXI-COSI FAMILYFIX ONE I-SIZE ISOFIX BASE 
        The car seat slots into the isofix base very easily and there is a traffic light system on the base to alert you if the car seat isn't fitted properly. The good thing about this base is that its compatible with some second stage car seats too, so you should only need one isofix base until the baby is around 4 years old.
                
        SECOND CAR SEAT: MAXI COSI PEARL (9KG TO 18KG)
        We were very happy with the Maxi Cosi brand so wanted to stick with it for Theo's second car seat / toddler car seat. The Maxi Cosi Pearl is one of the car seats that is also compatible with the Family Fix isofix base, so it was a bit of a no brainer for us. This car seat will last Theo until he is around 4 years old or 18kg. The good thing about the Pearl is that it can be rearward and forward facing in the FamilyFix isofix base.`,

        content: `Since becoming a Mum, I have been so conscious of all the extra waste that having a baby generates. Whether that be from nappies, baby wipes or food packing, it’s quite astounding how someone so small can still have such a big impact on household waste. I recycle as much as I can and always try to shop the most sustainable products, but I’m not perfect. I know that the most convenient options are often the least eco-friendly; baby wipes being one of them.
        
        That’s why I am proud to be supporting Huggies in their ‘Tiniest Footprint’ mission, which aims to eradicate plastic from their entire baby wipe range within 5 years, or sooner. They want to provide the gentlest skincare for babies whilst leaving the smallest environmental impact. At present, their wipes already contain up to 50% less plastic than other leading brands so they’re already well on their way to their plastic-free goal. I was amazed to learn that by using Huggies wipes, you can reduce plastic usage by the equivalent of 63 plastic bottles a year! That is pretty amazing and it’s small changes like this that can add up to a big difference.

        Show your support and you could win a one-month supply of Huggies wipes (12 packs). All you need to do is post a photo of your baby’s feet on Instagram with the hashtag #HuggiesTiniestFootprint and my handle @thetravelista in the caption. Here’s my entry below.`,

        title: 'A Whitby Mini Break with Baby',
        comments: 1,
        date: '31/10/19',
        content: `Last month we experienced our first little family holiday with baby in tow. I had plans to hop on a plane with Theo when he was a few months old. But Theo’s prematurity threw us a huge curveball and plans changed. Instead, we’ve decided to work our way up to an overseas trip next year by doing some UK staycations first. Living in Leeds, I wanted somewhere in close driving distance that would still feel like a nice escape. Being by the sea and only 1 hour and 20 minutes drive away, a Whitby mini break was an obvious choice for us.

        Our base for our 3 night Whitby mini break was the Rose and Crown Yard cottage, which we booked via cottages.com (read my review of the cottage here). I loved the look of the nautical interiors, the baby-friendly amenities and the fact that is was right in the heart of Whitby town. Being so central, it also meant that we were only a few minutes walk away from the harbour and 10 minutes from the beach.
        
        DAY 1
        After taking some time to load up the car with all our stuff (including a ridiculous amount of baby paraphernalia), we were en route to Whitby and crossing the beautiful North York Moors. Luckily, Theo slept the whole journey. We followed the sat nav directions to our holiday cottage, which was tucked away down a historical alley way off of Whitby’s Flowergate. I loved the hidden and quickly location of the cottage, which was a surprise even for me.
                
        After getting settled in the cottage, we went for a little stroll around Whitby Harbour. I hadn’t visited Whitby for about 10 years, and it had been even longer for Scott. We put Theo in the baby carrier and got our bearings during golden hour. The light against the water was beautiful and I started to feel myself relax into our little break. As Theo’s usually in bed by 7pm, we grabbed a fish and chips takeaway from The Magpie for dinner and it didn’t disappoint. Anyone that visits Whitby has to try The Magpie’s famous fish and chips.
                
        DAY 2
        I woke up excited for our plans to take Theo swimming for the first time at Raithwaite Coastal Retreat. The pool is located in the spa area, so it was lovely and warm for Theo’s first swim experience. He loved the water and it was such a joy to see him splashing around and take it all in. We also stopped for lunch at The Brasserie and I enjoyed a 30 minute back, neck and shoulder massage in the spa. It was such a treat!
                
        By mid afternoon we were back at the cottage so we decided to put Theo in the carrier and walk up Whitby’s famous 199 steps to Whitby Abbey. It felt amazing to explore the cobbled Whitby streets with Theo comfortably in tow. We took in the views of Whitby Harbour from the cemetery and took a stroll around the Abbey. The 199 steps is one of the most iconic parts of Whitby.
                
        DAY 3
        On the final day of our Whitby mini break we went for a long walk along Whitby Beach, with Theo in the carrier again. The trip definitely made me realise that exploring with a baby has to be done at a much slower and more leisurely pace, but that’s OK with me! We rounded off our final day in Whitby with an early dinner at Trenchers, which holds the prestigious title of best fish and chip restaurant in the UK in the 2019 Fish and Chip Awards. I opted for a fish pie which was delicious and Scott went for the famous fish and chips which he raved about.
                
        TOP TIP: A carrier is an absolute must for anyone visiting Whitby with their baby. It’s the perfect way to carry your baby around and means you don’t have to tackle the beach, steps or cobbles with a pram.
                
        Whitby isn't far from home but it gave us all a much needed dose of adventure and escapism. It also gave me the change to feel like a travel blogger again. I loved how this trip made me feel; like a new, better version of my old self. Still a travel blogger, just with a baby in tow.

        title: "REVIEW: A RESTORATIVE SPA BREAK AT GRANTLEY HALL, NORTH YORKSHIRE",
        comments: 0,
        date: '23/02/23',
        content: `Grantley Hall reopened in 2019 following £72m of investment and 4 years of renovation. Since then it has created a world-class, five star experience for its guests. Since winning Hotel of the Year at the 2022 AA Hospitality Awards, I knew I had to go and see it for myself, especially as it’s located in the Yorkshire Dales, only 30 minutes away from my home in York. So I felt very excited as I drove towards Grantley Hall one foggy Monday morning in February, ready for a blissful 24 hours of child-free luxury. Read on for my full Grantley Hall review.
        GRANTLEY HALL REVIEW FEB 2023
        Meeting me there was my best friend of 10+ years Naomi, who travelled across from Kendal for the experience. As Mums to two small humans, we were both equally grateful for the mini break. The first tip I can give you about Grantley Hall is not to trust your sat-nav to take you to the beautiful main entrance. Unfortunately both of our sav-navs took us to the service entrance, so we missed out on the grand approach to Grantley, across manicured lawns and a babbling stream.
        We did, however, still receive a true Grantley Hall welcome as we pulled up in our cars, with staff coming out to meet us, take our bags and offer valet parking. Despite accidentally coming in ‘round the back’, our Grantley welcome definitely set the tone for things to come.
        Feeling a little lighter with bags whisked away, we stepped into the elegant reception hall of the 17th-century Palladian mansion that is Grantley Hall. Light, airy and refined, we were shown into Norton bar, where we were offered a refreshing welcome drink.. Naomi and I drank it all in; the rich, sumptuous interiors and Grantley’s signature ‘apple lemonade'. This absolutely was a 5 star arrival and check in.
        LUNCH AT THE ORCHARD
        Having arrived around lunch time, we made our way to Apres at The Orchard, a pop-up restaurant at Grantley Hall. Located in a large bell tent and furnished with cosy faux fur throws, it had an indoor-outdoor ski lodge feel and a personality all of its own. I opted for the chicken schnitzel for lunch which was served with fries and a orange-yolked egg. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection and made for a tasty, indulgent lunch. The high level of service was maintained throughout and our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly.
        THE SUPERIOR SUITE
        By the the time we had finished lunch, our room was ready. A member of the reception staff personally showed us to our superior suite, which was accessed beyond the spa and through a unique glass-roof atrium with marble floors which made me feel as if I could have been in the Middle East. There is no expense spared on the architecture, styling and interiors of Grantley Hall.
        This was proven further when we stepped inside our Superior Suite, with its own super king size bed, living area, dining area and floor to ceiling marble bathroom. The room was sumptuous and spacious, with dual aspect windows across the manicured gardens. We loved the little details; a painting that elegantly furled to reveal the TV behind it, and the member of staff who brought us an extra glass vase for some valentines flowers that Naomi had brought me. Complimentary damson gin had been poured into a crystal decanter and we were told the mini bar was also complimentary.
        Check my Instagram for a full video tour of the Superior suite.
        The icing on the cake was the vast marble bathroom heated flooring and its own roll-top bath, hammam-style walk in shower (big enough for two), plus twin sinks. I definitely appreciated the Bvlgari toiletries and got the shock of my life when I opened the bathroom door to an automatic toilet lid then sat down to feel a heated toilet seat. It was an impressive touch but I did turn the heated toilet seat off as it seemed like an unneccsarary use of energy.
        THE THREE GRACES SPA
        We spent the afternoon of the first day and the morning of the second day at the Three Graces Spa, which received extensive renovation as part of the hotel’s £72m investment. The setting is beautifully relaxing and beyond the 18m pool, sauna and jacuzzi, the Three Graces Spa also has a steam room and a unique snow room. The indoor hydrotherapy pool connects to the outdoor pool, which steamed and bubbled in the crisp February temperatures.
        Neither of us are big drinkers but Naomi and I ordered a glass of prosecco to our poolside loungers and took them out into the outdoor pool. We caught up, laughed and put the world to rights whilst savouring every sip. This was one of my favourite moments of the whole trip.
        On Day 2, I returned to the Three Graces Spa for the Kundalini treatment which is a holistic experience using body energies. It is described as a back of the body experience to soothe and calm the central nervous system using chakra and sound healing therapy. It describes itself as much more than just a massage, and it truly was.
        
        The therapist explained a bit more information about the treatment and got started with a relaxing foot scrub and slowly inhaling some essential oils through the massage bed. The treatment involved heated Himalayan salts on different pressure points around the back.
        The whole ritual was heavenly and I think I could actually feel myself absorbing renewed energy from the powerful salts. So special.
        DINING AT EIGHTY-EIGHT
        We opted to eat at Eighty-Eight, Grantley Hall’s Asian-fusion restaurant, which is on the grounds in a separate building. What I loved about Grantley Hall is that each part of the hotel has its own identity, from the spa to the restaurants and communal areas. Being in Eighty-Eight felt as though we could have been in a buzzy high-end London restaurant, but I loved knowing we were actually in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside. A real juxtaposition!
        The level of service at Eighty-Eight was impeccable and the staff could have not been more knowledgable and passionate about the menu. They talked us through the concept of the restaurant and recommended we tried the 8-course tasting menu.
        Embracing the full experience, we went for the tasting menu and paired it with a few of the best margaritas I have ever had. I don’t tend to mix my drinks these days but the margs we’re so good I didn’t need to try anything else. Highlights of the tasting menu for me included the opening course of chicken tea (only in Yorkshire, hey?) as well as the grilled diver scallops and the Korean style pork belly. The 8 course tasting menu at Eighty-Eight is an incredibly special experience and ideal for surprising a loved one or celebrating a special occasion. The tasting menu is priced at £88 per person.
        Eighty-Eight is one of five restaurants within the hotel including the Michelin-starred Shaun Rankin at Grantley Hall.
        THE GROUNDS
        We also squeezed in a little walk around the grounds of Grantley Hall during our stay, and I only wish we had more time to explore further. Unique water features, a babbling brook and perfectly landscaped gardens are yours to discover and it doesn’t take long to feel a sense of calm within these gardens.
        THE FINAL SAY
        My friend and I were blown away by every single aspect of Grantley Hall. The high level of attention to detail is woven through every aspect of the hotel, from service, the interior design, the ambience and the food, to unexpected surprises within the guest experience.
        After everything I have described in this blog post, I am sure it won’t be surprising to know that Grantley Hall is not cheap. Rates start from £600 per night for a deluxe room, which is by no means a small sum. But after my own experience, I can say that Grantley Hall is truly on another level to other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. If you want something extra special and have the money to comfortably spend (or splurge) on a visit to Grantley Hall, there will be no regrets.
        Thanks to Grantley Hall for giving me, and the rest of the world, another reason to love and visit North Yorkshire.

        title: "MEDITERRANEAN CRUISE ITINERARY: VISITING 6 PORTS IN 7 DAYS",
        comments: 0,
        date: '10/10/22',
        content: `We’ve just got back from an amazing 7 day Mediterranean cruise with Princess Cruises. This was my third cruise, and the first cruise with my family. We had an amazing week on board Regal Princess and travelled through a total of 6 ports across Spain, France and Italy, including the embarkation and disembarkation ports. Our cruise itinerary was as follows;
        Day 1: Barcelona (embarkation)
        Day 2: At sea
        Day 3: Gibraltar
        Day 4: At sea
        Day 4: At sea
        Day 6: Genoa (Rapallo)
        Day 7: Livorno (Florence)
        Day 8: Civitavecchia (Rome)
        The amazing thing about cruising is that you get to cover so much ground and visit multiple destinations with minimal effort. It felt so special waking up in a new place every morning, with my son and partner along for the ride.
        Read on to find out what we did in each destination and how we got from the port to our heart of each destination. I've also included some of my top tips based on our own experience.
        This blog post has been created as part of a paid content campaign with Princess Cruises. All words, views and photos are my own. 
        VISITING 6 PORTS IN 7 DAYS ON OUR MEDITERRANEAN CRUISE
        1. BARCELONA
        Barcelona was the starting point of our 7 day Mediterranean cruise. We flew in the day before, which gave us some time to explore Barcelona. We hopped on the Aerobus from Barcelona Airport to the Placa Espanya, where our hotel was located. We managed to squeeze in a visit to the viewing platform at Arenas de Barcelona shopping centre, some authentic Spanish tapas, a walk down Las Ramblas and a metro ride (which our train-obsessed son loved). To reach the Port of Barcelona we hopped in a 15 minute taxi which was reasonable and very easy.
        We stayed 1 night at The Onix Fira Barcelona which is a good value hotel and ideal for a one night stopover.
        Top Tip: Barcelona's Aerobus is a super easy and cheap way to get from Barcelona Airport to the city centre. One way tickets cost only 5.90 euros and the buses go from the arrivals terminal every 5-10 minutes. But be aware that face masks are still obligatory on buses in Spain and you will be refused a ride if you are not wearing one (we learnt this the hard way!). This was in September 2022.
        2. GIBRALTAR
        The first port of our Mediterranean cruise was Gibraltar which was a great introductory destination. As Gibraltar is a small island, there were no long transfer times. You could simply step off the ship and walk in to the town centre. We booked a dolphin spotting shore excursion which was incredibly special and memorable (the cost was $79.95 per adult). We saw so many common and bottle nose dolphins! After the shore excursion ended we caught a public bus before catching the cable car up to the top of the rock of Gibraltar!
        The rock of Gibraltar is best known for the monkeys that live on it and for the historical cable car that can take you up. It’s a unique experience and a must for anyone spending the day in Gibraltar. We even found a little playground for Theo near the Commonwealth Park.
        The rock of Gibraltar is best known for the monkeys that live on it and for the historical cable car that can take you up. It’s a unique experience and a must for anyone spending the day in Gibraltar. We even found a little playground for Theo near the Commonwealth Park.
        3. MARSEILLE
        After a sea day on board Regal Princess, we docked at Marseille, France. Instead of booking a shore excursion for Marseille, we booked return coach transfers from the port and explored in our own time. The cost for the transfers was $16 per adult, and our son went free. The transfer took around 25 minutes and felt easy and convenient.
        Before the day I researched ‘child friendly things to do in Marseille’ and found ‘Le Petit Train de Marseille’, a hope-on-hop-off tourist train operating 2 different routes across the city. This was the perfect activity to do with our son as we got to see lots of Marseille whilst keeping him entertained by the ride. The train took us up to the famous Notre Dame de la Garde which towers over the city. The cost was 9 euros per person and our son went free.
        We soaked in the views from the Notre Dame and explored the cathedral before coming back down to wander around the Vieux Port. This is where we found Bar de la Marine, a bar used to film the proposal scene in Love Actually!
        4. RAPALLO (GENOA PORT)
        The second half of our cruise included major Italian ports which serve as gateways to some of the most iconic destinations in Italy. From the city of Genoa, you can access the spectacular Cinque Terre as well as the coastal town of Portofino. Genoa itself also has a lot to offer if you don’t fancy a longer transfer.
        We opted for a shore excursion to the coastal town of Rapallo, which is the neighbouring town to Portofino. The guided tour included transfers to Rapallo, a short walking tour of the old town, a coffee and pastry stop as well as lunch and a cooking demonstration at Dao Vittorio in Recco. This historical restaurant dates back to 1865 and has been passed down the same family for 6 generations. The food was phenomenal and it tasted even better after seeing how the pesto and focaccia is traditionally made.
        Our day in Rapallo was my favourite of the whole cruise because everything just went so smoothly, Theo was so well behaved and the food was incredible. Had we not have booked on to the shore excursion there is no way we’d have had this unique experience. The exact tour was the Princess cruises Rapallo and pesto tasting and cost $149.95 per person which is relatively high for a shore excursion because it included a generous amount of food and drink.
        5. FLORENCE (LIVORNO PORT)
        Livorno was our final port of the cruise which is the gateway to Tuscany and to beautiful towns such as Florence, Pisa, Siena and San Gimignano. Scott and I road-tripped Tuscany in 2016 so I couldn’t wait to return, but now as a family with our son. We booked a ‘Florence on your own’ shore excursion via Princess Cruises, which included a guide-led transfer to and from the city.
        Even though we were exploring Florence independently, it was nice to have a local guide give us tips and advice for our day during the transfer. I knew this would be the longest transfer of our cruise, but unfortunately traffic and a toilet stop took the transfer from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. In hindsight, a 4 hour round trip was just far too much for a young child and it was a bit of a lesson for us to be more selective on shore excursions with long transfers.
        I re-read my City Guide to Florence to retrace our steps and find my favourite restaurant from our old trip. Unfortunately Osteria di Giovanni was closed on the day we visited (amazing, authentic restaurant off the beaten paths which I highly recommend), but we found a great alternative in Ristorante Pensavo Peggio, which is located on the same street, Via del Moro. We also booked tickets to the Interactive Leonardo Da Vinci Museum as we felt it would be the most engaging museum for our 3 year old. Unfortunately he was still a little young for the museum and the activities within it so we whizzed round the whole thing in around 25 minutes.
        I loved having the opportunity to return to Florence but it didn’t feel like a very child-friendly city, so we did struggle at times. But as my Mum says, Florence will always be there! We can return another time to enjoy it as a couple, or when Theo is older.
        6. ROME (CIVITAVECCHIA PORT)
        Civitavecchia was the disembarkation port of our mediterranean cruise, which provides easy access to the city of Rome. I would have loved to tag a couple of extra nights in Rome but we’d already been away for 2 weeks at this point and Scott couldn’t take any more leave.
        A great tip for booking a cruise is to consider your embarkation and disembarkation ports, how accessible they are to you and if they’re good places to extend your holiday by a few nights.
        We absolutely loved our Mediterranean cruise with Princess Cruises and can’t wait to cruise again as a family soon.
        GOOD TO KNOW
        Good news! Princess Cruises is running this same cruise itinerary on Enchanted Princess in 2023, meaning you too can experience a 7 night Mediterranean cruise from £549 per adult.
        Alternatively, if you fancy experiencing the same cruise ship but a different cruise route, Regal Princess will be sailing from Southampton for the 2023 season with 8 night cruises from £649. If you’re based in the UK like me, this means you can enjoy this amazing cruise ship without taking a flight.

        My stay at Howbeck Lodge was part of a press invitation in exchange for a blog review. All words and photos are my own.
        
        Their spacious tents offer proper beds with mattresses, fluffy bedding, hot showers and a toilet, whilst still allowing you to immerse yourself in nature in the most peaceful of settings. With no electricity and minimal Wi-Fi, its a chance to disconnect from every day life and spend quality time with the most important people in your life.
        
        You’re challenged to cook your meals and make hot drinks on a wood burning stove, which is all part of the fun. You can collect freshly laid eggs from the farm hens, fire up the barbecue and hand-grind your own coffee beans. And when you’ve had enough of stoking fires, you can get freshly made pizzas and home cooked farmhouse meals delivered to your tent. Heaven!
        
        
        
        
        
        HOWBECK LODGE AT A GLANCE
        Howbeck Lodge is a family-run farm and campsite located just outside the village of Hesket Newmarket in the North Lakes. Hesket Newmarket is a small village with a local pub which serves meals, a post office and a lovely children’s playground. This is all in 5 minutes walking distance (maybe a bit longer for little legs).

        The next village along is Caldbeck, which is larger with a village pub, a couple of cafes and boutique shops, as well as an Old Mill with shops and stream running through it. Both villages are well worth exploring and provide lovely, simple trips out with kids in tow. There are also plenty of beautiful walks and hikes in the area that are worth exploring. Some of these start from or go through Hesket Newmarket.

        OUR TENT
        The Feather Down Farm tents at Howbeck Lodge are incredibly spacious with a lovely rustic feel to them. The tents sleep up to 6 people, with a double bedroom, a double ‘snug’ room off the living room, and single bunk beds (perfect for kids).
        
        
        
        There is a main living area with dining room, sofa, kitchen area and wood burning stove. All cooking equipment and crockery is provided, so you can literally just turn up and enjoy! By night, the cosy space can be lit by putting candles in the many hanging lanterns provided. There is also a bathroom with a flushable toilet, small sink and a hot shower which is heated by gas. Towels are also provided.

        Close to the tents there is a babbling stream which I could hear at night when lying in bed. It was so relaxing! My son loved exploring the stream and having a paddle. TIP: Pack wellies or beach shoes!
        
        
        
        You are welcome to bring your own food for your stay, but there is also the options to pre-order breakfast hampers and barbecue packs. We got the breakfast pack and it was incredibly generous, full of full sized branded products. We had more than enough for our stay and it felt like a real luxury!
        
        
        
        
        
        FAMILY-FRIENDLY FARM
        Howbeck Lodge is incredibly family friendly, with lots of farm animals for children to meet and interact with including sheep, chickens, horses and a shetland pony. As long as supervised by an adult, children are welcome to pet the animals, enter their enclosures and collect eggs from the hens. There’s also two football goals and plenty of space to run around and play.
        
        
        
        GOOD TO KNOW
        A few bits of information I learnt whilst staying at Howbeck Lodge;
        
        Whilst there is no electricity within the individual tents, plug sockets are available to guests in the communal shower block, meaning you can still charge your phone and blow dry your hair - if you want to! Also in this shower block are communal fridges.
        There is also a cool box within the tents. They stay cool by using frozen hot water bottles which are supplied on site for free.
        As well as being a site for Feather Down Farm luxury glamping tents, Howbeck Lodge is also an independent business and campsite where people can pitch up their own tents. These tents are in a neighbouring area of the farm.
        For parents worrying about kids waking early due to the summer light, don’t fear! You can roll the blind down for each window of the tent which makes it completely blackout - a massive plus I wasn’t expecting.
        Pack wellies so kids can play in the nearby stream.
        Howbeck Lodge is a family-run business and the family still live in the main farm house onsite. Christine and her son did a wonderful job of looking after us. Meeting them gave it a really personal touch.
        Wheelbarrows are available for transporting your things from your car to your tent. You cannot park directly outside your tent.
        Dogs are not allowed.
        
        
        Glamping in the Lake District with Feather Down Farms is the perfect introduction to camping, or for those with young families who need that extra bit of convenience. I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay here to friends, family and of course to you, my lovely readers.
        
        Prices for a Feather Down Farm at Howbeck Lodge start from £44o for 2 nights, £490 for 4 nights and £730 for 7 nights. Please note the farm closes for the winter season from October to March, reopening for the spring season on 31st March.

        title: "5 ways to make your bedroom feel like a 5 star hotel",
        comments: 0,
        date: '06/10/22',
        content: `Nothing beats the feeling of checking into a luxurious hotel. But what if you could create a similar feeling in your own home? After travel blogging for almost 10 years, I have been lucky enough to have reviewed many 5 star hotels. Drawing on my own experience, I have teamed up with The Fine Bedding Co to share 5 ways to make your bedroom feel more luxurious.

        This blog post has been sponsored by The Fine Bedding Company. All words are my own.
        
        5 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR BEDROOM FEEL LIKE A HOTEL
        1. INVEST IN A STATEMENT BED
        The centre piece of every 5 star hotel room is always the bed. Usually king size or even super king, they dominate the room and draw your attention. Choosing something with a high headboard or a textured fabric is a great way to add a touch of luxury. We recently upgraded our bed from a double to a king size and it has made a huge different to the feel of the bedroom.

        2. DE CLUTTER YOUR SURFACES
        The joy of arriving in a hotel room is that there is never any mess. There are clean lines and surfaces which immediately make you feel calm. You can replicate that same feeling of calm at home by decluttering any surfaces in your bedroom and giving them a good clean. It sounds simple but will make a huge impact!

        3. TREAT YOURSELF TO GOOD QUALITY BEDDING
        The fluffy duvets, the plumped cushions and the silky soft sheets; nothing beats that feeling of slipping into a luxury hotel bed. Investing in good quality bedding is one of the easiest ways to make your bedroom feel like a hotel. I’ve always spent a bit extra on good quality bedding because I know it washes better, lasts longer and helps me sleep better.
        
        
        
        The Fine Bedding Company’s Night Owl Range is used within the bedrooms of many 5 star hotels all over the world.

        4. ADD A SIGNATURE SCENT
        Hotels have a way of awakening the senses, and often when checking into a hotel room I am met with a gorgeous new scent. Whether you purchase a simple plug-in scent or indulge in a luxurious diffuser, adding a new scent to your bedroom will make it feel like a new and inviting space to be in your home. On my wish list is the Velvet Rose and Oud diffuser from Jo Malone. I have the perfume and it’s my favourite ever scent.

        5. ADD TEXTURE AND COLOUR THROUGH SOFT FURNISHINGS
        For finishing touches, try adding some soft furnishings to your bedroom. These could include additional cushions on the bed, a cosy throw at the foot of the bed, a rug on the floor or new curtains. Layering soft furnishings can add depth, texture and colour to your room. I generally try to stick to the same colour theme but mix up the textures.

        date: '13/07/22',
        content: `Having lived in Leeds for 5 years, it is a UK city that will always have a place in my heart. In that time I have managed to discover the very best of the city, which I am now compiling into this definitive weekend Leeds guide. There is so much more to Leeds than meets the eye, but it’s a case of knowing where to look. From the incredible indie food scene to the vibrant markets and historical arcades, Leeds is oozing with colour and character.

        So if you’re planning a trip to Leeds any time soon, you’re in the right place. In partnership with Visit Leeds, this guide and itinerary covers my favourite restaurants, free activities, unique offerings, best shopping spots and historical hidden gems.

        LEEDS GUIDE: INTRODUCING LEEDS
        Leeds is a Northern UK city located in the county of West Yorkshire. It is the 4th largest city in the UK with a population of 812,000 (source; 2021 census). Now in 2022, the city has so much more to offer beyond it’s Northern industrial roots. There’s an incredible indie food scene, brilliant arts and culture, spectacular architecture, a vibrant nightlife and arguably the best shopping in the North of England.
        
        The pedestrianised city centre is lively and compact and a short walk will take you to the likes of Leeds Docks and Granary Wharf, both of which have their own charm and character. From Michelin star restaurants to authentic food stalls, you can eat like a King in Leeds, whatever your budget. Read on to find out how to spend a weekend in Leeds.
        
        This blog post has been created in partnership with Visit Leeds for their This is My City campaign. I have designed every aspect of the itinerary based on my favourite places in Leeds. I have visited all places featured many times as a local.

        A WEEKEND LEEDS GUIDE: HIGHLIGHTS AND HIDDEN GEMS BY A LOCAL
        LEEDS GUIDE - ITINERARY DAY 1 - CULTURE, FUN AND INDIE FOOD
        AM - CATCH THE WATER TAXI FROM GRANARY WHARF TO LEEDS DOCK
        Your Leeds adventure begins at Granary Wharf, a convenient starting point for anyone arriving into the city by train. Granary Wharf is located directly behind Leeds train station (tip; if arriving by train consider a stay at Doubletree by Hilton in Granary Wharf for maximum convenience). The canals and locks of Granary Wharf make it a calming and characterful place to be and there are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes to sample.
        
        From Granary Wharf, hop on one of Leeds’ unique Dutch water taxis, named Twee and Drie. The water taxis operate between Granary Wharf and Leeds dock and allow visitors and locals to see Leeds from a different perspective. The water taxis run between 10am to 6pm every 15 minutes and the fare is just £1 - children under 5 go free. You can even pay by card or Apple Pay.

        AM - VISIT THE ROYAL ARMOURIES AT LEEDS DOCK
        Your 10 minute water taxi ride will take you through the heart of the city, straight to Leeds Dock and right outside the Royal Armouries, the UK’s national museum for Arms and Armour. It’s full of fascinating artefacts including Henry VIII's armour. The museum is completely free to enter and no pre-booking is required, so it’s up to you whether you spend 30 minutes or 3 hours here.

        AM - WALK FROM LEEDS DOCK TO THE TETLEY
        A cultural morning in Leeds continues with a short 5 minute walk to The Tetley, a contemporary art gallery in the art deco headquarters of the former Tetley Brewery. The building in itself is something to admire with it’s beautiful tiling and it’s exposed 1920’s style lift in the centre. The exhibitions are ever-changing and if you’re visiting with kids, be sure to take them to the Mini Tetley exhibition; an interactive permanent exhibition room and play area on the third floor. Admission to The Tetley is also free, no pre-booking required.

        PM - LUNCH AT SARTO PASTA
        By now you should have worked up an appetite, so take another 10 minute walk from The Teltey into the city centre where you’ll find Sarto Pasta. Sarto is one of my absolute favourite indie restaurants in Leeds, mainly because it does the best pasta I've tasted outside of Italy!
        
        It’s small and select menu offers fresh handmade pasta with unique flavours and the highest quality ingredients. It also caters for veggies, vegans and those needing gluten-free options. It’s also child-friendly. Whilst they don’t have a kids menu, when I visited with my son they happily catered for him with a bespoke tomato pasta dish. What’s not to love?

        PM - GET COMPETITIVE AT JUNKYARD GOLF
        After a leisurely lunch, it’s time to get competitive with a game of crazy golf, but not as you know it! Leeds’ Junkyard Golf is the home of weird and wacky crazy golf, fun cocktails and all things junk. The zany cocktails are a must-try and be prepared for loud music and a fun underground scene. Over 18s only. Pre-booking is essential and courses range from £8.50 (off peak) to £10 (peak) per game.
        
        Alternative child-friendly option; if you’re visiting with kids switch Junkyard Golf for a visit to the Thackray Medical Museum. There’s a brilliant children’s play zone, a walk through Victorian street and engaging activities throughout the exhibitions. Kids under 5 go free.

        PM - VIBES AND PIZZA AT BELGRAVE MUSIC HALL
        Another one of my absolute favourite hang-out spots in Leeds. Belgrave Music Hall spreads over an amazing 3-floor 1930’s venue. It’s open daily offering craft beers and brilliant indie food stalls. The rooftop terrace is a must on sunny days and it has a year-round programme of live gigs, comedy, film and art in the music hall itself. This place is full of good vibes, delicious eats and cool people.
        
        Dinner recommendations: after a big lunch at Sarto, have a casual (and cheaper) dinner by sampling one of the two fast food outlets within Belgrave Music Hall. Currently in residency is Dough Boys pizza and Patty Smiths burgers. Everything is freshly made to order, great value and ridiculously delicious.

        LEEDS GUIDE - ITINERARY DAY 2 - SHOPPING, ART AND SUSHI
        AM - BROWSE THE INDEPENDENT RETAILERS IN THE COLOURFUL LEEDS CORN EXCHANGE
        The Leeds Corn Exchange is a thing of architectural beauty. This impressive dome-like grade 1 listed building was completed in 1863 and is now home to a unique mix of independent retailers selling everything from vintage clothing to artisan cheese. Take a fascinating stroll and a browse around. It’s unlikely you’ll leave here empty handed.

        AM - CHECK OUT KIRKGATE MARKET
        Minutes from the Leeds Corn Exchange is the equally historical Kirkgate Market; one of the largest indoor markets in Europe. Not everyone knows that this market is home to the original Marks & Spencers market stall, which still exists in the market today. The market dates back to 1875 and is a real hub within Leeds city centre. Browse the stalls and if you’re feeling peckish try out some bargain world food in the lower food hall.
        
        
        
        AM - BROWSE THE LEEDS’ SHOPPING QUARTERS - INCLUDING THE LESSER KNOWN ONES
        A stone’s throw from Kirkgate Market are Leeds’ beautiful and historic shopping quarters. Victoria Quarter is the biggest, and most well known, which has been likened to the famous Galleria Vittorio in Milan. Here you’ll find Leeds’ most upmarket shops and jewellers. 
        
        
        
        Venture a little further and you’ll find some of the smaller and lesser-known arcades. Thornton’s Arcade is one of my favourites, with unique independent businesses including a quirky comic book shop, tattoo parlour and unassuming gin bar.

        Victoria Gate is the newest and most modern shopping quarter which connects to a huge multi-story John Lewis. I love the contrast between old and new, sitting side by side.
        
        
        
        PM: VISIT THE TILED HALL CAFE AND LEEDS ART GALLERY
        The Tiled Hall Cafe is an amazing space in Leeds that could easily be missed (another of my favourite places in the city. Read my dedicated blog here). It’s located within Leeds Art Gallery, so after a morning of shopping, head here for lunch or a coffee to rest weary feet.
        
        This grand Victorian hall is covered in turquoise and coloured tiles which date back to the 50's and 60's. These beautiful tiles were covered with boards and shelving for years but in 2007 the hall had a huge renovation with English Heritage to restore the hall back to it's former glory - and rightly so! After you’ve refuelled, spend your afternoon exploring the diverse exhibitions of Leeds Art Gallery. Admission is free and there is a small indoor play and learning area for children.

        PM: DINNER AT ISSHO
        Many of the recommendations and activities included in this itinerary are completely free, but this final suggestion is a bit of a splurge. Issho is a contemporary Japanese restaurant located within Victoria Gate. I’ve been here many times and can absolutely vouch that you will get incredible food and top-class service. The whole thing is an experience.

        Start with a drink in the bar or rooftop terrace before heading through to the restaurant where there is an open kitchen and a hot coal grill. The decor is perfect and the vibe is great. And you don't need to be a sushi lover to enjoy Issho. There are plenty of other options for veggies and meat eaters alike. Dinner for two (without alcohol) cost us £80.

        LEEDS ITINERARY OPTIONAL DAY 3 - A DAY TRIP TO KNARESBOROUGH OR HARROGATE
        If you’re visiting Leeds for a long weekend or have an extra day to play with, I recommend hopping on a train and exploring the nearby towns of Knaresborough or Harrogate. Both towns are less than 1 hour away from Leeds by train (Knaresborough is 45 minutes and Harrogate is 30 minutes on the same line).
        
        Head to Knaresborough to discover a beautiful riverside town with al fresco riverbank cafes, hire a classic rowing boats and visit the well-known Mother Shipton’s Cave. Head to Harrogate for a classic afternoon tea at Betty’s tea rooms or visit the famous Harrogate Turkish Baths. Both towns are much smaller than Leeds and you can explore everything on foot from the train stations, making for brilliant day trip options.

        WHERE TO STAY - HOTELS IN LEEDS
        Here are some hotels in Leeds which would be perfect for a weekend break.
        
        Dakota Deluxe Hotel, Russell Street - Featuring 84 bedrooms, Dakota Leeds is arguably the most luxurious hotel in Leeds with a sensual, contemporary feel. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Leeds train station. Read my Dakota Deluxe review.
        Malmaison Leeds, Swinegate - Once a bus and tram company office, this hotel retains its unique architecture, including a vaulted ceiling and quirky rooms, which come in different shapes and sizes.
        Briggate Hotel, Lower Briggate - Affordable boutique accommodation in Leeds, 100 metres from Trinity Leeds and only a 2-minute walk from Leeds train station.
        Doubletree by Hilton Leeds City Centre (Granary Wharf)- This hotel is situated in the waterside Granary Wharf area, only 2 minutes' walk from Leeds Railway Station and a 7-minutes' walk from the city centre shops. It's in the perfect location for following this itinerary from the Granary Wharf starting point.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        I hope this Leeds guide can come in useful for some of you. Whether you pick out a few ideas and do your own thing or follow the itinerary to the letter, I promise you all of these recommendations have been tried, tested and loved by me many times before.

        comments: 2,
        date: '16/06/22',
        content: `I recently was lucky enough to experience a 5 night ‘European Sampler’ cruise on board Enchanted Princess. Departing from Southampton UK, this mini European adventure included stops at Rotterdam (Amsterdam), Zeebrugge (Bruges) and Guernsey (UK channel island). It also allowed one full day at sea, where I was able to enjoy all the amazing facilities on board Enchanted Princess.

        Enchanted Princess is cruising from Southampton for the whole of Summer 2022, and there are plenty of Southampton cruise deals to choose from, including a 4 night ‘sampler’ cruise to Rotterdam and Guernsey from £379 per person. There are also 7 night Mediterranean cruises from £459 per person. Tempting right? But before you think about a cruise of your own, get to know Enchanted Princess a little better in this ultimate cruise ship guide.

There’s also a state-of-the-art gym, a theatre, a sports court, basketball courts, mini golf, an open air running track, the Lotus spa with its own hydrotherapy pool and wellness area, a casino, bars, nightclubs, a kid’s club and so much more.

        ENCHANTED PRINCESS: WHAT’S INCLUDED
        From a la carte dining to West End-calibre entertainment and the kids club, so much on board is inclusive of the price of your cruise. You could dine a la carte for every meal of your cruise at no extra cost in the main dining rooms, or enjoy fresh local food in the expansive World Fresh Market, the ship’s buffet dining option. As a parent myself,I think fact that the kids club is inclusive and can be used every day of the cruise is brilliant and it massively enhances this cruise ship’s appeal to families.
        
        When you’re not off the ship exploring different ports, there is a whole programme of daily activities and entertainment which is all inclusive of the cost of your cruise. Look out for the Daily Patter arriving on your bed at turndowns service each night to see ‘what’s on’ the next day.

        GO ALL-INCLUSIVE WITH PRINCESS PLUS
        Water, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks are not included in the cost of your cruise, although upgrading to the Princess Plus package (£40 per day per adult) allows guests up to 15 alcoholic drinks per day (up to the value of $12 each).
        
        It also includes all unlimited Medallion Net Wi-Fi and gratuities, so this package does provide excellent value for money. We were signed up to the Princess Plus package on our recent cruise and we definitely made the most of it.
        
        If you enjoy having a few drinks each day on holiday it’s an option worth considering. For those that don't drink alcohol, it wouldn't be cost effective.

        AWARD-WINNING MEDALLION CLASS
        Every guest on board Enchanted Princess gets to travel in MedallionClass, which means you’re given a Medallion which is, quite literally, the key to your cruise. The Medallion is the size of a ten-pence coin and through the clever Medallion technology, you can check in and out of the ship with ease, enter your stateroom and even pay for extras around the ship, meaning there's no need for cash or a bank card. You also get access to the newly designed MedallionClass app, in which you can order drinks or room service to your state room, or anywhere else on the ship. Guests are asked to carry the Medallion with them at all times and the cruise shops even sell accessories and jewellery so you can carry it in style.

        ENCHANTED PRINCESS STATEROOMS AND SUITES
        There are a variety of staterooms and suites to choose from to suit all budgets. The lowest price cabins are the interior cabins. Whilst these cabins don’t have a window, they will provide you with brilliant value. On my recent press trip I stayed in a mini suite which was wonderfully spacious, with its own lounge area that can convert to a bed (ideal for families). The mini suite also had its own balcony and I was impressed that the bathroom had a full sized bath tub. Our personal steward Henry provided excellent service throughout the whole cruise which really enhanced the mini suite experience.

        SPECIALITY DINING
        There are 3 speciality dining restaurants on board Enchanted Princess, which you can experience a 3-5 course meal at for a surcharge of around $29 per head. Ranging from Sabatini’s Italian restaurant ($25pp) to the Crown Grill steakhouse ($29pp) and even the Chef’s Table Lumiere ($115pp for multiple courses with wine), you can expect exceptional food and service in these restaurants. My favourite speciality dining experience was Sabatini’s as the flavours and ingredients were so authentically Italian, as was our waiter!
        
        There's also Ocean Terrace seafood bar which serves freshly made sushi and Salty Dog Gastro Pub. Both of these places charge by the dish rather than a set menu price. All the other restaurants on board are inclusive of your cruise price including a la carte options. 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        ENTERTAINMENT
        The standard of entertainment on board Enchanted Princess was definitely an unexpected bonus for me. For two nights of the cruise we visited the main theatre after dinner to watch 2 productions; Rock Opera and Five Skies. The cast were extremely talented. Without giving too much away, you can expect mesmerising singing, dancing, costumes and special effects. It was far from cabaret. I’d definitely recommend checking out the shows for a great way to round off your evening on board the ship.
        
        
        
        THE KIDS CLUB: CAMP DISCOVERY
        I was very impressed by the expansive Camp Discovery kids club facilities on the ship. There are three separate rooms for different age groups spanning from 3-7, 8-12 and 12-17. Each room is perfectly equipped for the age of the kids in it, and the youngest room even has a small soft play area and an outdoor play deck. As a Mum, I looked at everything on my recent from a parents' perspective and there are so many child and teen friendly aspects of a Princess Cruise. The Kid’s Club is just one of my 9 Reasons to try Cruising with Kids.

        THE ENCLAVE AT LOTUS SPA
        The Lotus Spa offers a fantastic range of treatments during your cruise but for an extra-special experience, guests can book access to The Enclave, home to Princess’ largest-ever thermal suite. There’s a hydrotherapy pool with rain showers and air jets, a hammam Turkish steam bath, herbal steam chamber, dry sauna and heated stone beds. There are also experience showers which have to be tried! I spent over an hour in The Enclave before my Himalayan Salt Stone massage and collectively the experience was phenomenal. It’s hard to wrap your head around that you can experience all of this whilst sailing at sea on a cruise ship. Surreal but amazing!

        THE STAFF
        The staff are another asset of Enchanted Princess. I can think of various moments when I really felt like staff went ‘above and beyond’ to meet my needs. From Harry the bartender at Good Spirits bar who edited the recipe to make me my perfect margarita, to January the therapist in The Lotus Spa who make me feel so at ease and relaxed during my treatment. Nothing is too much trouble for them. I also love that the staff are encouraged to let their personality shine through and share humour with the guests. The service is brilliant but there is a friendly informality amongst the staff which really puts you at ease.

        SHORE EXCURSIONS
        When it comes to docking in the ports, there are a number of ways to experience each place. Princess Cruises offer organised tours in each destination, which you can book on to  in advance of your cruise, or when you are onboard. It’s better to book early to ensure you secure a space. The tours differ in each port and there is usually something to cater to all ages and fitness levels. Some last a full day, and others are just a half day. They offer something called the Princess Promise which means that if you find the tour cheaper elsewhere, they will refund you the difference.

        Other ways to explore the ports is to book a transfer into the heart of the place you are visiting, and spend the day exploring on your own. Just be sure to check when the last transfer back to the ship is.

        Sometimes the ports are too small for the cruise ship to dock in, so it lays anchor offshore instead. For these ports, all guests can catch the free tenders to the shore. We did this on our final port day in Guernsey and didn’t book a tour so that we could explore the island independently. The other option for shore days is to spend all day on the ship, if you prefer to take it easy that day, but personally I am all for exploring each port I stop at on the cruise!

        title: "How to plan a holiday in 5 easy steps",
        comments: 0,
        date: "17/05/23",
        content: `Whether you’re travelling with friends, family or solo, holidays are a great way to escape the daily routine and feel a sense of adventure. But the planning aspect of a holiday can often feel overwhelming amongst our busy lives. Luckily, we’re here to tell you, it doesn’t have to. If it’s down to you to plan a holiday but have no idea where to start, you’re in the right place. In this article, we are going to share how to plan a holiday in 5 easy steps, with plenty of insider tips. Once the planning is done, you can sit back, relax and enjoy the experience, making memories that will last for years to come.



        HOW TO PLAN A HOLIDAY IN 4 EASY STEPS
        STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR DESTINATION 
        Usually, the planning of a holiday all starts with a chosen destination. However, it’s important to consider your month of travel and what the weather will be like in your chosen destination during that time. For example, if you’re based in the UK and want to fly to Thailand during the school summer holidays, you’ll be visiting during their rainy / monsoon season. Other things to think about in your chosen destination might be; How child-friendly it? How expensive is it? What is the flight time? Can I fly from my local airport? What’s the tipping culture like? How good is the public transport? Is it LGBTQ+ friendly? 
        
        
        
        STEP 2: CHOOSE THE RIGHT ACCOMMODATION
        Choosing the right accommodation for your holiday is an essential part of a successful and enjoyable trip. There are numerous options to choose from, including hotels, private home rentals, bed-and-breakfasts, hostels, and camping sites. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s important to take into account the needs and preferences of who you will be travelling with, as well as their budget. If you’re travelling with kids, self-catering may be a great option. If you’re travelling with elderly relatives or someone with a physical disability, think about the accessibility of your accommodation. 
        
        Once you have settled on the type of accommodation that will be best for your holiday, you can start searching for the perfect place in your chosen destination. Having the destination and accommodation type decided as step 1 and step 2 will help you to narrow down your search terms for example; villas in Marbella or hotels in Wilmington de. We recommend checking the location, amenities, price and reviews before booking any accommodation.
        
        Top Tip: Location is key to having a convenient, stress-free and enjoyable holiday, so be sure to check the accommodation’s location out on Google Maps and check it’s proximity to some places and attractions you’d like to visit. 
        
        
        
        STEP 3: PACKAGE HOLIDAY OR DIY? 
        We would always recommend pricing up your chosen holiday both as a package with a reputable travel company, and individually by booking your flights and accommodation separately. You’ll always get the best rates by booking directly with the hotel itself and direct bookings are most likely to receive room upgrades.. Depending on the time of year and the demand, you’ll find a different outcome every time. Package holidays will often include things like airport transfers and more options on board-basis, so it’s worth taking this into consideration when deciding on the cheapest option. 
        
        
        
        STEP 4: RESEARCH AND PLAN A ROUGH ITINERARY 
        Before you embark on your holiday, be sure to research your destination thoroughly. Do any of the top attractions, experiences or restaurants require advance bookings? Planning a rough itinerary in advance will ensure that you make the most of your time and don’t miss out on any of the great attractions or opportunities available in your destination. 
        
        However, it’s also nice to leave some room for flexibility and relaxation. This will allow you to make the most of unexpected experiences and take advantage of opportunities that may arise during your trip. Consider leaving a few days open-ended or without concrete plans so that you can explore new places or take advantage of unexpected opportunities. This is especially important if you are traveling to somewhere totally unfamiliar and different. 
        
        
        
        STEP 5: BUDGET WISELY
        When planning a holiday, budgeting is essential for having a stress-free experience. If you’re planning a low cost holiday, be sure to make sure that the destination itself is cheap as well as the accommodation you’re booking. You might find a great deal on somewhere in the heart of Dubrovnik, but when you land you’ll realise it’s one of the most expensive places in Europe (mostly down to the Game of Thrones boom).
        
        It’s also well-worth doing some research on the local tipping culture, which can vary hugely between countries and continents.  Travel insurance is another crucial part of budgeting for your vacation. It can cover you in the event of an injury, missed flights, stolen possessions, and more, giving you peace of mind that you are financially protected if something goes wrong.
        
        Once you’ve booked your holiday, here are some further tips to help keep you relaxed and safe whilst on holiday
        
        Before leaving home, research the safety advisories for the areas you will visit and make sure to stay on top of any changes in security during your trip. When it comes to personal safety, trusting your gut instinct is important. If something doesn’t feel right or seems too good to be true, it’s best to avoid it.
        It can also be helpful to research local tourist scams area you will be visiting before you leave home so you know what to avoid when you arrive.
        It’s worth keeping expensive jewellery behind at home or in the hotel safe when travelling, and if you’re travelling with cash try to spread this out and not keep it all in one place.
        Always keep the address of your accommodation written down in the local language in case you get lost and keep your bags closed and close to your body in busy, crowded areas. 
        
        
        FINAL THOUGHTS
        Holidays are one of the most rewarding parts of life and by taking the time to plan ahead and do your research, you can ensure a stress-free and smooth-running travel experience. Whether it’s researching restaurants or budgeting for activities, there are plenty of ways to maximise your trip. Above all else, remember to take some time to disconnect from everyday life while on holiday and truly relax. So start planning today. Nobody ever regrets researching their holiday like a pro!

        date: "25/04/23",
        content: `Dubai-based travel blogger and destination expert Robeena Brown shares everything there is to know about a Dubai dune buggy experience.  // In my opinion, one of the very best ways to explore the Dubai desert is by renting a buggy in Dubai. A series of memorable activities are incorporated into the tour itinerary, which makes this activity an exciting and memorable experience. Exploring the Dubai desert on a buggy tour is a highly sought-after experience for tourists looking for an escape from Dubai's busy city atmosphere.

        This tour, whether taken by an individual or a group, is the greatest way to explore the Rub al-Khali, one of the biggest deserts in the world. The tour as a whole usually lasts between 3 and 6 hours, even though the buggy ride only lasts for approximately an hour. Continue reading to learn more about the Dubai dune buggy adventure.

        Professional guides and instructors will provide assistance on how to operate the buggy and will lead you through the entire activity.
        Learn intriguing facts and information about the desert during the ride.
        TYPE 1 : DUBAI'S DESERT TOUR BY DUNE BUGGY
        Experience an expedition like no other as you drive an 800cc buggy across the peaks and valleys of the stunning desert scenery while navigating the sand dunes. You can take a pause during the journey to refuel and let the adrenaline wear off. In order to help you recover from the exhilarating ride, some trips also include a barbecue dinner. The morning experience normally lasts three hours from the time of hotel pickup, but the barbecue-filled afternoon adventure lasts roughly six hours. Hotel pick-up is usually scheduled for the early morning, either at 7 a.m. or 3 p.m. in the afternoon.
        
        TYPE 2: CAMEL TIDE AND SANDBOARDING, EXPERIENCE WITH BUGGY TOUR
        For those seeking a complete desert experience and a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, consider adding a camel ride and sandboarding to your buggy tour. You won't miss a single aspect of the desert, and the day will be unforgettable.  This experience is usually conducted in three different locations, Hajar, the Lehbab area, which is 50 kilometers away on the outskirts of Dubai, or the red dunes of Dubai. You'll also have the opportunity to visit a camel farm and take a short ride on these iconic desert animals. But that's not all. You can also go sandboarding with an expert guide across the dunes of the Dubai desert.

        TYPE 3: DESERT SHOW AFTER BUGGY TOUR
        Immerse yourself in a once-in-a-lifetime experience by going on a buggy tour in Dubai that includes camping in the desert and a mesmerizing dance show in the middle of nowhere. In addition to the buggy ride, there are numerous other activities you may take part in, such as getting a henna tattoo, riding a camel, visiting a typical desert camp, dressing up in Arabian attire for a picture session, or smoking sisha. This full-day tour promises to provide a wealth of new experiences, whether you're traveling alone, with a partner, or with family.
        
        You can take in a breathtaking sunset and a belly dance or Tanura dance performance during the day. The tour's highlight, though, is a multi-course barbeque meal served outside beneath the stars that will undoubtedly revive you after a full day of discovery and adventure.
        
        
        
        DUBAI DESERT BUGGY TOUR COSTS
        Depending on whether the tour only includes the buggy ride or includes extra activities like camel riding, dance performances, barbecue, sandboarding, and traditional dress-up with a photo opportunity, the price of a Dubai desert buggy tour can range from AED 500 to more than AED 600. That's between £110-£130 GBP.
        
        WHAT TO WEAR ON A BUGGY TOUR IN THE DUBAI DESERT
        To ensure a comfortable and safe experience on the Dubai desert buggy tour, it is important to dress appropriately according to the high temperatures, strong winds, and intense sunlight. Wearing comfortable clothing that covers your entire body is recommended, along with a hat or cap and sunglasses for protection. Additionally, it is crucial to wear closed and comfortable footwear. Don't forget your suncream.

        title: "Top 3 places for a family friendly cottage holiday in Cornwall",
        comments: 0,
        date: "17/04/23",
        content: `Cornwall is undoubtably the jewel of our British south coast. Soft sandy beaches, aquamarine coves, quaint holiday cottages, water-sports and a microclimate blowing in from the Mediterranean; what’s not to love? Despite it’s booming popularity in recent years, I think it' still the ultimate place to go in the UK for a family friendly beach holiday.

        Cornwall is an incredibly family-friendly place, but knowing where to base yourself can feel like an overwhelming decision for parents in planning mode. Luckily I have done the shortlisting for you and narrowed it down to 3 locations for you. Read on for my location guide and recommendations for family friendly cottages in Cornwall.
        
        This blog post has been sponsored by Cornwall travel experts Aspects Holidays. All words are my own.
        
        TOP 3 PLACES FOR A FAMILY FRIENDLY COTTAGE HOLIDAY IN CORNWALL
        PERRANPORTH
        Perranporth is a firm family favourite in Cornwall, primarily for its spectacular sandy surf beach which stretches for over 3 miles at low tide. The beach is great for watersports and even has its own bar, The Watering Hole, where parents could enjoy a stress-free sundowner whilst the kids play safely on the beach. How blissful does that sound? The Watering Hole also has its own surf school.
        
        Perranporth is also conveniently located on the South West Coast Path out to St Agnes, meaning families have easy access to stunning heather-topped coastal walks that can be as long or short as you like. There's also a great selection of places to eat including restaurants, cafes and takeaways (for the nights tired parents don’t feel like cooking). Fish and chips, Cornish pasties and cream teas are all on hand in Perranporth.
        
        
        
        WHERE TO STAY IN PERRANPORTH.
        If you’re looking for a family friendly self-catering cottage in Perranporth, check out The Rosery. It sleeps 6, has on site parking, an enclosed garden, a wood burner and is even dog friendly too. As well as being family friendly, parents will love its extremely light and stylish decors as well as the roll top bath. In the garden there is a Wendy house and a hammock for kids to enjoy and the 17th century Bolingey Inn is just a 5 minute walk away.

        NEWQUAY
        Newquay is an award-winning family friendly beach resort and has recently been named ‘Best Family Holiday Destination’ by readers of COAST magazine. It also won the gold award for ‘Best Seaside Towns for Families’ by Days Out With Kids.
        
        With all these accolades, there’s no denying that Newquay is a haven for families. Firstly, there’s Newquay’s iconic Fistral Beach; one finest surf beaches in the UK and arguably the whole of Europe. Dramatically framed by two rocky headlands, Fistral offers families surf schools, equipment for hire, seafront facilities, car parking, showers and toilets. Don’t miss Rick Stein’s Fistral Restaurant and takeway which is right on the beach.
        
        Beyond Fistral there are plenty more beaches to discover (be sure to check out Lusty Glaze), a bustling town with shops, bars and restaurants, as well as a peaceful harbour with turquoise water and bobbing boats. For kids there’s also Newquay Zoo and the Blue Reef Aquarium.
        
        
        
        WHERE TO STAY IN NEWQUAY
        Newquay has an abundance of options for your family friendly cottage holiday but we love Spring Cottage . Beyond its beautiful aesthetic and interiors it sleeps 6, has an enclosed garden with stylish outdoor seating area, a woodburner, on site parking, bunkbeds and is dog friendly. It’s located in the Newquay village of Crantock and is only yards away from a golden sandy beach. This is our top pick!

        If you need a larger property sleeping up to 8, we recommend Deer Park. This larger, characterful property dates back to the 18th century and is in the heart of Newquay town. The property is also dog friendly and has an outdoor BBQ and seating for up to 8 people, however it does not offer onsite parking so is better suited for those visiting without a car.

        ST IVES
        Our third and final location pick for family-friendly holidays in Cornwall is the quaint coastal town of St Ives. Oozing with independent shops, restaurants and art galleries, it is a place that attracts creatives and families alike. There are endless beaches to choose from and our top 3 for families are; Porthgwidden, Porthminster and Porthmeor. Kids will also love taking a boat trip from St Ives Harbour out to seal island, sea glass collecting on the beach and visiting the Tate St Ives art gallery.

        For smaller groups and families of up to 5, we recommend Out of The Blue. Located in the heart of St Ives town, this cosy and characterful cottage has gorgeous interiors, dual aspect sea views from the top floor and a parking space (located 7 minutes from the property). It’s worth nothing that this property is spread over 3 floors.

        Alternatively in St Ives, there’s also Parc Cottage which sleeps 6, boasts sea views, has a balcony, parking and even an EV charge point. It’s dog friendly and modern in style with an open plan kitchen, living and dining space. Kids will love the bunkbeds and breakfast on the balcony, overlooking the famous St Ives Harbour.

        title: "Review: Exploring the capital on an afternoon tea London river cruise",
        comments: 0,
        date: "27/03/23",
        content: `One of the very best ways to explore London, and to piece all of the sights together, is from the River Thames. From Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, all the way to Canary Wharf, a river cruise allows you to soak up all of London’s most iconic sights from the comfort of a relaxing cruise. There are a variety of different London river cruise options so always do your research, but City Cruises offer a fantastic and affordable programme of cruises, such as the 24-hour hop-on-hop-off sightseeing cruise as well as themed cruises including the afternoon tea and jazz dinner cruises.

        I was recently invited to review an afternoon tea river cruise with City Cruises, which is set to be one of the most popular things to do in London for families during the upcoming Easter holidays. Read on for my full review.

        REVIEWING THE AFTERNOON TEA LONDON RIVER CRUISE
        I was greeted by friendly City Cruises staff who showed me on to the river cruise boat. The downstairs of the boat is where the afternoon tea takes place. It’s warm and indoors which is great to know considering the unpredictable British weather.
        
        After setting off on the cruise, the attentive serving staff offered me a choice of tea or coffee (both of which are unlimited as part of the package). They also handed over a menu which had non-inclusive drink options such as wine, beers and champagne. Shortly after setting off, the afternoon tea was served in the classic 3-tier stand of sandwiches, scones and patisserie cakes. It was fresh, beautifully presented and tasted delicious. My favourite thing, as always with any afternoon tea, were the scones. Lashing of jam and clotted cream is a must!

        It was lovely to see lots of international families on the cruise, enjoying what was probably a highlight and very special experience of their trip to London. The cruise itself lasted 1 hour, during which time we passed by Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, The Tate Modern, the Millennium foot bridge, Tower Bridge, the HMS Belfast, The Tower of London, Canary Wharf and so much more. There was commentary throughout the cruise, pointing out all the main sites.
        
        The City Cruises Afternoon Tea Cruise costs £52 per adult and £41 per child between ages 2 and 12. Under 2’s go free. Considering the average price for an afternoon tea in London, I think this experience provides good value for money as you are able to combine two experiences of a London river cruise and a London afternoon tea into one.
        
        
        
        MY TOP TIPS FOR A LONDON RIVER CRUISE
        Be sure to try and arrive at the departure pier early to ensure you bag a table by the window for the best views.
        Although the afternoon tea is the main event of the experience, I would definitely recommend heading up to the open top deck during your cruise to get the best photos and take in a 360 degree vista of London. Especially for when the boat passes under Tower Bridge. That is an iconic moment!
        The afternoon tea river cruise is a family-friendly experience, however, if you are thinking of booking with children I think it would be best suited to the ages of 6 and up. Younger children may get a bit restless.
        The afternoon tea city cruise departs from Tower Millennium pier. If you’re planning to visit other main attractions whilst in London, consider combining the afternoon tea city cruise with a trip to the Tower of London as it is right next to the pier.
        If you’re going to be in London between 17th April to 8th May, City Cruises will be celebrating the Royal Coronation of King Charles III with decorated boats, Royal-themed deserts, activities for children and more.

        title: "The perfect, cosy North Yorkshire cottage for your next escape",
        comments: 2,
        date: "09/03/23",
        content: `I love being a travel ambassador for my home county of North Yorkshire because it is such a beautiful part of the UK, with an abundance of things to see and do. It’s all on my doorstep, so I often take it for granted. But last weekend I was a traveller in my own home county, discovering new places such as Staithes and Runswick Bay. Along with my family (including my 4 year old son), I spent 2 nights at The Workshop, a beautiful 2 bed cottage near Malton in North Yorkshire. If you’re planning your next UK weekend break, read on for my review of this cosy North Yorkshire cottage.

        The Workshop North Yorkshire
        
        This blog post is part of a paid collaboration with Classic Cottages. All words are my own.
        
        THE WORKSHOP - THE PERFECT NORTH YORKSHIRE COTTAGE
        The Workshop is a characterful, yet modern 2 bed cottage located near the market town of Malton. Converted from an 200-year old farm workshop, it is now a spacious and luxurious cottage, with heated floors, fluffy towels and premium bath products. The second bedroom can be prepared as a king size bed or two twin beds, catering for kids perfectly. French doors open onto an enclosed garden with a barbecue and seating, and a larger walled garden is also adjacent to the property.
        
        Also located on the same estate (approximately 200m away) is Garden Cottage. Booking both properties at the same time would be an ideal option for larger groups of up to 8 or for two families looking to go away together.
        
        
        
        ARRIVING AT THE WORKSHOP
        We arrived at The Workshop on a Friday afternoon and found it easily with the help of our sat nav, and the clear instructions from Classic Cottages. Hidden down a quiet country lane and surrounded by a scattering of other rural properties, The Workshop has its own driveway right in front of the property – handy for unloading the car.
        
        The February air was cold, but as soon as we stepped into the cottage we felt the cosy warmth coming from the underfloor heating. The entrance hall was spacious, spotless and grand, and I instantly felt relaxed. Going through to the main downstairs living space, we were delighted to see that the wood burning stove had been pre lit, which was such a welcoming aspect of our arrival.
        
        Waiting for us on the vintage butchers block was a welcome hamper filled with fresh farm eggs, milk, a bag of ground coffee, freshly baked bread and a jar of homemade marmalade. It was such a thoughtful touch. Whilst these things will get you started if arriving late at night, I would recommend bringing food supplies with you on arrival as the property is in a rural location with no local amenities. In terms of crockery and cooking equipment, everything you could need is provided.

        SETTLING IN AT OUR NORTH YORKSHIRE COTTAGE
        We thought ahead and brought all the supplies we needed for the weekend, including a Gousto meal for 4 which my Dad cooked up. We kept the fire going and enjoyed a cosy night in the cottage. With books, board games, and Netflix to hand, there was everything we needed for a cosy night in.

        My son and I slept in the second bedroom, which can be set up as a king size bed or two large singles. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I loved hearing the pitter patter of rain on the Velux sky lights as I fell asleep. Bliss.

        LUXURIOUS TOUCHES
        From the soft down-filled bedding to the fluffy towels and premium Bath House toiletries in the bathrooms, The Workshop had all the comforts you'd expect from a luxury hotel. I loved sinking into the bath tub on night 2 with my book and plenty of bubbles and bath salts. The cottage was also spotlessly clean. I really cannot fault it.
        
        
        Bedroom 2 at The Workshop, North Yorkshire cottage
        
        
        THOUGHTFULLY CATERING FOR LITTLE ONES
        As a Mum, I really appreciated all the child-friendly touches of the cottage that will make life so much easier for parents of little ones. Firstly, a cot, high chair and stair gates are available and there are even plug socket protectors for curious hands.
        
        I really appreciated the plastic beakers in the kitchen cupboards for my 4 year old, as well as the fire guard that had been set around the wood burning stove. But the best feature for little ones is the play area in the nearby walled garden, complete with Wendy house, swing, slide and climbing wall. Theo absolutely loved discovering this and it was an unexpected bonus of our stay.
        
        
        
        DAY TRIPS FROM THE WORKSHOP
        With The Workshop as your base, you’ll have so many amazing day trip options, many of which are under 10 miles from the property itself. As a local myself, I’ve put together my recommendations for the best day trips that are all within a 1 hour drive of the cottage.
        
        
        Staithes North Yorkshire shop window
        Castle Howard (7 miles) - Castle Howard is one of the most spectacular stately homes in the whole of the UK with extensive grounds, gardens, walks and playgrounds that are equally as impressive.
        
        York (21 miles) - My hometown needs little introduction. You cannot help but fall in love with the historical charm of York. Check out my local’s guide to York.
        
        Whitby (28 miles) - My favourite coastal town in all of Yorkshire. As well as the beach, Whitby’s gothic history is full of character and the cobbled streets are perfect for exploring. Fish and Chips at The Magpie or Trenchers is a must.
        
        Staithes (33 miles) - During our stay at The Workshop we chose to venture a little further to Staithes, a small coastal town which is known for its artists and galleries. Head to the Cod and Lobster in the harbour for lunch or a drink by the sea.
        
        Staithes harbour view point in Feburary
        Staithes Harbour
        Runswick Bay (33 miles) - Another new discovery during our stay at The Workshop. Runswick Bay is a beautifully framed sandy beach with waves to rival Cornwall. I can't wait to return here in summer. Pair a trip to Staithes and Runswick Bay in one day.
        
        Saltburn-by-the-Sea (32 miles) - Another fantastic option for a coastal day trip, Saltburn beach is one of the best in Yorkshire.
        
        PERFECT FOR KIDS;
        
        Flamingo Land (4 miles) - From rollercoasters for thrill seekers to a fantastic conservation-led zoo, Flamingo Land is a perfect family day out.
        
        Eden Camp (5 miles) - Little ones can learn about wartime history at this engaging and interactive museum which is set across a series of bunkers. You can even step foot inside a submarine.
        
        North York Moors Steam Railway (8 miles) - Train enthusiasts will adore taking a trip across the North York Moors on a traditional steam train. Hop on at Pickering and go as far as Whitby.
        
        The Workshop offers visitors the perfect North Yorkshire cottage for any staycation or UK short break. Stay from 3 nights up to 2 weeks and enjoy all that this beautiful part of England has to offer.

        title: "Review: A Restorative Spa Break at Grantley Hall, North Yorkshire",
        comments: 0,
        date: "23/02/23",
        content: `Grantley Hall reopened in 2019 following £72m of investment and 4 years of renovation. Since then it has created a world-class, five star experience for its guests. Since winning Hotel of the Year at the 2022 AA Hospitality Awards, I knew I had to go and see it for myself, especially as it’s located in the Yorkshire Dales, only 30 minutes away from my home in York. So I felt very excited as I drove towards Grantley Hall one foggy Monday morning in February, ready for a blissful 24 hours of child-free luxury. Read on for my full Grantley Hall review.





        My stay at Grantley Hall was a press stay, provided complimentary in exchange for this honest review.
        
        GRANTLEY HALL REVIEW FEB 2023
        Meeting me there was my best friend of 10+ years Naomi, who travelled across from Kendal for the experience. As Mums to two small humans, we were both equally grateful for the mini break. The first tip I can give you about Grantley Hall is not to trust your sat-nav to take you to the beautiful main entrance. Unfortunately both of our sav-navs took us to the service entrance, so we missed out on the grand approach to Grantley, across manicured lawns and a babbling stream.
        
        We did, however, still receive a true Grantley Hall welcome as we pulled up in our cars, with staff coming out to meet us, take our bags and offer valet parking. Despite accidentally coming in ‘round the back’, our Grantley welcome definitely set the tone for things to come.
        
        Feeling a little lighter with bags whisked away, we stepped into the elegant reception hall of the 17th-century Palladian mansion that is Grantley Hall. Light, airy and refined, we were shown into Norton bar, where we were offered a refreshing welcome drink.. Naomi and I drank it all in; the rich, sumptuous interiors and Grantley’s signature ‘apple lemonade'. This absolutely was a 5 star arrival and check in.
        
        
        Insider tip: Be sure to ask to see the cocktail library wall for a fun surprise
        
        
        
        
        
        
        LUNCH AT THE ORCHARD
        Having arrived around lunch time, we made our way to Apres at The Orchard, a pop-up restaurant at Grantley Hall. Located in a large bell tent and furnished with cosy faux fur throws, it had an indoor-outdoor ski lodge feel and a personality all of its own. I opted for the chicken schnitzel for lunch which was served with fries and a orange-yolked egg. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection and made for a tasty, indulgent lunch. The high level of service was maintained throughout and our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly.
        
        
        
        
        
        THE SUPERIOR SUITE
        By the the time we had finished lunch, our room was ready. A member of the reception staff personally showed us to our superior suite, which was accessed beyond the spa and through a unique glass-roof atrium with marble floors which made me feel as if I could have been in the Middle East. There is no expense spared on the architecture, styling and interiors of Grantley Hall.
        
        This was proven further when we stepped inside our Superior Suite, with its own super king size bed, living area, dining area and floor to ceiling marble bathroom. The room was sumptuous and spacious, with dual aspect windows across the manicured gardens. We loved the little details; a painting that elegantly furled to reveal the TV behind it, and the member of staff who brought us an extra glass vase for some valentines flowers that Naomi had brought me. Complimentary damson gin had been poured into a crystal decanter and we were told the mini bar was also complimentary.
        
        Check my Instagram for a full video tour of the Superior suite.
        
        
        
        
        
        The icing on the cake was the vast marble bathroom heated flooring and its own roll-top bath, hammam-style walk in shower (big enough for two), plus twin sinks. I definitely appreciated the Bvlgari toiletries and got the shock of my life when I opened the bathroom door to an automatic toilet lid then sat down to feel a heated toilet seat. It was an impressive touch but I did turn the heated toilet seat off as it seemed like an unneccsarary use of energy.
        
        
        
        
        
        THE THREE GRACES SPA
        We spent the afternoon of the first day and the morning of the second day at the Three Graces Spa, which received extensive renovation as part of the hotel’s £72m investment. The setting is beautifully relaxing and beyond the 18m pool, sauna and jacuzzi, the Three Graces Spa also has a steam room and a unique snow room. The indoor hydrotherapy pool connects to the outdoor pool, which steamed and bubbled in the crisp February temperatures.
        
        
        
        
        Neither of us are big drinkers but Naomi and I ordered a glass of prosecco to our poolside loungers and took them out into the outdoor pool. We caught up, laughed and put the world to rights whilst savouring every sip. This was one of my favourite moments of the whole trip.
        
        On Day 2, I returned to the Three Graces Spa for the Kundalini treatment which is a holistic experience using body energies. It is described as a back of the body experience to soothe and calm the central nervous system using chakra and sound healing therapy. It describes itself as much more than just a massage, and it truly was.
        
        The therapist explained a bit more information about the treatment and got started with a relaxing foot scrub and slowly inhaling some essential oils through the massage bed. The treatment involved heated Himalayan salts on different pressure points around the back.
        
        The whole ritual was heavenly and I think I could actually feel myself absorbing renewed energy from the powerful salts. So special.
        
        
        
        
        
        DINING AT EIGHTY-EIGHT
        We opted to eat at Eighty-Eight, Grantley Hall’s Asian-fusion restaurant, which is on the grounds in a separate building. What I loved about Grantley Hall is that each part of the hotel has its own identity, from the spa to the restaurants and communal areas. Being in Eighty-Eight felt as though we could have been in a buzzy high-end London restaurant, but I loved knowing we were actually in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside. A real juxtaposition!
        
        
        Eighty Eight is located in the rounded modern building to the right of the original building.
        
         
        
        The level of service at Eighty-Eight was impeccable and the staff could have not been more knowledgable and passionate about the menu. They talked us through the concept of the restaurant and recommended we tried the 8-course tasting menu.
        
        
        
        Embracing the full experience, we went for the tasting menu and paired it with a few of the best margaritas I have ever had. I don’t tend to mix my drinks these days but the margs we’re so good I didn’t need to try anything else. Highlights of the tasting menu for me included the opening course of chicken tea (only in Yorkshire, hey?) as well as the grilled diver scallops and the Korean style pork belly. The 8 course tasting menu at Eighty-Eight is an incredibly special experience and ideal for surprising a loved one or celebrating a special occasion. The tasting menu is priced at £88 per person.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Eighty-Eight is one of five restaurants within the hotel including the Michelin-starred Shaun Rankin at Grantley Hall.
        
        THE GROUNDS
        We also squeezed in a little walk around the grounds of Grantley Hall during our stay, and I only wish we had more time to explore further. Unique water features, a babbling brook and perfectly landscaped gardens are yours to discover and it doesn’t take long to feel a sense of calm within these gardens.
        
        
        
        THE FINAL SAY
        My friend and I were blown away by every single aspect of Grantley Hall. The high level of attention to detail is woven through every aspect of the hotel, from service, the interior design, the ambience and the food, to unexpected surprises within the guest experience.
        
        
        
        After everything I have described in this blog post, I am sure it won’t be surprising to know that Grantley Hall is not cheap. Rates start from £600 per night for a deluxe room, which is by no means a small sum. But after my own experience, I can say that Grantley Hall is truly on another level to other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. If you want something extra special and have the money to comfortably spend (or splurge) on a visit to Grantley Hall, there will be no regrets.
        
        
        
        
        
        Thanks to Grantley Hall for giving me, and the rest of the world, another reason to love and visit North Yorkshire.

        comments: 0,
        date: "12/01/23",
        content: `Cornwall is somewhere I am always excited to return to. After discovering the beauty of Newquay and St Ives, I am ready to explore a little further and choose somewhere new for our next base. Whilst planning my own trip back to Cornwall, I have rounded up my current top 5 places to stay in Cornwall. I hope this comes in handy for anyone else doing the same.

        TOP 5 PLACES TO STAY IN CORNWALL
        1. NEWQUAY
        The surfers paradise of Newquay gets the first spot on my list because its the place I stayed during my first ever trip to Cornwall, and I loved it! Located on the north coast, tourists and holidaymakers flock to Newquay, and for good reason. Choose between the bracing surf on Fistral Beach and the soft sand haven of Lusty Glaze beach. Add in its surf shops, festivals, award-winning restaurants and cool bars, you’ll see that Newquay has it all.
        
        If you like the idea of staying in a vibrant town with beaches, attractions and amenities (as opposed to a smaller, sleepier Cornish village), then Newquay could be for you. I also think it’s a good options for families with young children as it offers visitor attractions such as the Blue Reef Aquarium and Newquay Zoo.
        
        Lastly, it’s home to Cornwall’s main airport, so if you’re flying in for your Newquay holiday, you won’t have far to get to go to reach your accommodation.

        2. PERRANPORTH
        If you fancy staying somewhere a little smaller but still with a spectacular beach, Perranporth is a popular family resort. A little further down the north coast, Perranporth has miles of golden sandy beach, cafes, bars and even its own riding school offering epic horse rides on the beach (check out Reen Manor Riding Stables). You can also surf, snorkel, sail and swim on Perranporth Beach. When the tide is out, walking up the beach to Ligger Point (2 miles away) is an absolute must.

        3. FALMOUTH
        Falmoth is considered to be Cornwall’s maritime Mecca. Its large, glittering harbour is white-washed with an impressive collection of yachts and it is also home to the award-winning Maritime Museum. It’s said to be the best place to take a boat trip in Cornwall as there are so many destinations and boat styles to choose from.
        
        But if you’re not the nautical type, Falmouth is also known as a foodie destination with many fantastic restaurants and including the michelin-starred Hooked on the Rocks. In terms of other things to do in this exciting market town, there’s the beautiful beaches, the impressive Pendennis Castle and World Heritage sites and gardens.

        4. ST IVES
        If you love art, culture and supporting independent businesses, then the popular town of St Ives may be the place for your next Cornwall cottage holiday. First and foremost, St Ives is home to the Tate St Ives gallery which is located on the seafront and focuses on British artist exhibitions. There is also the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, located in the artist’s former studio.
        
        I visited St Ives during my last trip to Cornwall and loved how many independent shops and businesses lined the harbour and surrounding streets. You could spend a whole day just browsing the shops and stoping for refreshments along the way. Bliss! The harbour area is extremely quaint and picturesque with some of the most turquoise waters I’ve ever seen in England, but beware it does get extremely busy in high season.
        
        One of the best things to do in St Ives is to take a boat trip to Seal Island to visit the seal colony; a great activity for children and adults alike. In terms of beaches, Porthmeor Beach is the main surfing beach and was awarded Blue Flag Beach status again in 2021. Porthgwidden Beach is a sheltered and quiet beach that is popular with families. Seasonal dog bans apply on these beaches.

        5. PADSTOW
        Last but certainly not least is Padstow, the foodie capital of Cornwall. This picture perfect coastal village is home to an impressive 5 Michelin star restaurants. Scattered around its working harbour you’ll find a gorgeous selection of boutique shops, pubs, galleries, bars and restaurants.
        
        Top things to do in Padstow include catching the ferry over to the upmarket village of Rock (where there are two more Michelin stars), hiking the stunning South West Coast Path and for the little ones; Camel Creek Adventure Park. I think a coastal cottage in Padstow would be my first choice for our 2022 summer holiday.

        content: `It’s 30th December 2022. I am currently at home, sat on my bed with my laptop and a big mug of Yorkshire tea - a must for this Yorkshire girl. It’s raining outside and I can hear my son playing downstairs with his Dad. It feels nice to step away from the Twixmas bubble for an hour or so to write this blog post. A bit of time for me, and for reflection on the year just passed. It’s been a while since I’ve posted a longer, more personal blog, so here goes!


        Bruges in May 2022 as part of a European cruise with Princess Cruises
        
        MY YEAR AT A GLANCE
        1 new house
        17 destinations
        4 UK short breaks
        9 countries visited
        4 international campaigns
        3 tourism board / DMO campaigns
        3 new countries with my son; Cyprus, France and Italy
        1 award-nomination; best travel blog at the Yorkshire Blogger Awards
        
        I QUIT MY JOB
        I think the biggest headline for my 2022 was that in July I quit my job and returned to being a full time travel creator. I like to think this shows the positive recovery of the travel industry in a post-Covid world, but also my determination to get back to doing what I love. Before the pandemic, The Travelista had been my full time job since 2016. The pandemic and its lockdowns had a huge impact on my earnings, so in 2020 I took a job as a Comms Officer for a UK charity.
        
        At the time, this job was exactly what I needed. A guaranteed income and an opportunity use my existing skills in a totally different industry. But I knew I needed to keep creating content for my blog and social channels if I ever wanted to return to doing it full time again (which I absolutely did!). So I worked on my blog in my spare time, starting with evenings and weekends and then increasing to 1 day a week when my son could do an extra day in child care.
        
        
        
        Fortunately, the blog work began to slowly pick up again, to the point where it felt as though I was working 2 jobs. I began to struggle to meet campaign deadlines. Between the comms job, trying to keep The Travelista going, trying to buy a house and being a Mum, I became mentally stretched and close to burn out. In May of this year I decided it was time to hand in my notice and take the leap back into self employment. Once you have that set and secure income, it does feel quite daunting to walk away from it, especially when you’ve got a new house and a big new mortgage to pay. But do you know what? I haven’t looked back once.
        
        Since leaving the job I now have 4 days a week to work on The Travelista, and this in itself is liberating. I have so much more mental head space to come up with new ideas for expansion (watch this space) and to create quality content I feel proud of, rather than rushing something out at the end of a long day, just to stay active. The Travelista will celebrate its 10th Birthday in March of 2023 and I have been planning something big to mark this. Coming soon!
        
        
        
        FINDING BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND GLOBAL
        This year I also launched a new angle for The Travelista, which is
        
        ‘inspiring your local and global adventures’.
        
        I chose this strapline as I feel it authentically reflects how I now travel as a Mum, whilst still allowing me to capture and create the travel content I love. Not all my trips can be to international or long-haul destinations now, nor do I want them to be. I want to share a nice balance of local and global travel, and to show people that adventure and escapism can also be found close to home, as well as internationally. I think realising this can be really liberating, especially for parents of little ones. One thing that is for sure though, is that The Travelista will always remain a travel blog. That is a promise.
        
        So in 2023, there will continue to be a mix of UK short breaks and getaways, combined with some European and long-haul trips. In 2022 I travelled overseas to Abu Dhabi, Cyprus, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland, but we also had some UK family breaks to the Lake District, Whitby and Edinburgh. I am really happy with the balance I created this year and hopefully you will see this reflected in my content.
        
        I was especially proud to work with Visit Leeds, Visit England and the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative this year, as I love promoting tourism in my nearby cities, as well as overseas.

        LEARNING HOW TO TRAVEL AS A FAMILY
        Although my son is now 4, I feel as though we are only now learning how to travel as a family, rather than child-free. Because of the pandemic and my son’s premature arrival, it took a lot longer than I expected to start travelling together. In 2022 I realised how different it is to travel with a child in tow and how it brings an entirely new set of challenges and requirements. Of course, when they’re a baby, they have basic needs and can just ‘come along for the ride’. But thanks to Covid, we missed out on that part entirely.
        
        No longer do we slowly walk 20,000 steps to explore a city on foot, no longer do we sit al fresco in a cafe for long chats and people watching, no longer do we indulge in fancy 3-course dinners. I would be completely lying if I said I didn’t miss these aspects of travel and being in a new place. I absolutely do! And I hope to still enjoy these things again in the future.
        
        
        
        But for now, instead, we are actively seeking out activities and attractions that will engage our son, looking out for hazards, grabbing quick lunches and thinking of ways to entice him to walk an extra 100m without asking to be carried. If you know, you know.
        
        The hotels and destinations I would pick for myself when child-free are completely different to the places I would be seeking out with my son. It truly is a big adjustment and to be honest, it comes with some major sacrifices. But travel with a young child also comes with some moments of pure magic; seeing them experience things for the first time and seeing them meet people from around the world. Some of my favourite travel moments of 2022 with Theo include;
        
        Seeing dolphins in the wild in Gibraltar
        Dancing on the deck of a cruise ship in the Mediterranean sea.
        Seeing his wonder as we caught the Metro in Barcelona - his first time on an underground train
        Watching him meet the wildlife in the Bio Dome in the Granada Science Park.
        I have also loved seeing how adaptable Theo can be when he is in an entirely new place, doing an entirely new thing. And this is despite being a lockdown toddler who barely went anywhere between the ages of 1 and 2. He definitely takes after me!

        CONCLUSION AND GOALS FOR 2023
        Writing this post has really helped me to take stock of the year just passed and appreciate what I have achieved. I am really proud of myself for taking the leap back in to full time travel blogging and I am excited for the new opportunities I know this will bring in 2023. Lots more travel, both in the UK and abroad, with my family, and also sometimes solo! I want to show regular women like me can continue to travel after having a family.
        
        In 2023 I hope to keep evolving and expanding The Travelista, and to also set up a secondary publication to run alongside it. I would love to also run my first group trip in 2023, which would be an opportunity to travel alongside like minded people who are part of my online community (if you’re reading this, that means you too!).
        
        
        
        As well as my travels for work, Scott and I have both agreed that in 2023 we are going to cherry-pick our own family holiday next summer that has zero work commitments for myself, so I can properly switch off. We’re thinking Greece, Majorca or Portugal. If anyone has any great family resort recommendations in these destinations, let me know.
        
        This brings me to the end of my 2022 year in review. Whether you’re new here or you’ve followed my journey for years, thank you so much for being here, for every blog visit, like, comment and share. It is this amazing, supportive and loyal community that has enabled me to quit my job this year and return to blogging full time. Onwards and upwards! 
        
        Wishing you all a healthy and happy 2023.
        
        Love, Jess.`,
